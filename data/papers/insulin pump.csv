"Personality Traits, Metabolic Control and the Use of Insulin Pump Functions in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: An Observational Single-Visit Study.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33325007/),"
While a few studies have assessed the association between personality and metabolic outcomes in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM), there have been none in adults or in subjects treated with insulin pumps, and hypoglycaemic episodes have not been considered in these studies. The aim of this observational single-visit study was to assess the association between personality traits and metabolic control, hypoglycaemic episodes and insulin pump use in adult T1DM patients.
Data were obtained from 52 adults with T1DM treated in a tertiary care centre (no complications or comorbidities; aged 27 ± 8 years; diabetes duration of 12.8 ± 6.8 years; treated with insulin pumps for 6.3 ± 0.4 years). ""Big Five"" personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness) were assessed using the NEO-Five Factor Inventory questionnaire. Data on HbA1c, blood glucose levels, frequency of glucose testing, the number of hypoglycaemic episodes (< 3.9 mmol/l), basal and prandial insulin doses, and the number and types of boluses in the last 14 days were obtained from the insulin pumps and glucometers.
The mean levels of the assessed parameters were: HbA1c 7.2 ± 1.2% (55.0 ± 13.1 mmol/mol), episodes of hypoglycaemia 7.0 (3.00-9.75) and glucose tests per day 7.3 ± 3.9. All personality traits showed average intensity. None of the traits were associated with HbA1c, glycaemia, number of glucose tests, or number or kind of insulin boluses. Conscientiousness was the only factor associated with the incidence of hypoglycaemia in both univariate (r =  + 0.46, p < 0.001) and multivariate (β =  + 0.41, p < 0.001) analyses.
Despite results reported for children and adolescents, personality traits of adult patients with T1DM were not essential for metabolic control assessed by HbA1c or for the use of insulin pump functions; however, higher conscientiousness may be related to more frequent hypoglycaemic episodes. Extrinsic factors should be searched as more relevant for metabolic control and proper use of very expensive insulin pump therapy.

Managing Type 1 Diabetes among Saudi adults on insulin pump therapy during the COVID-19 lockdown.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33310178/),"
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected people's lives including patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). We aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on psychological status, self-management behaviors, and diabetes care maintenance among Saudi adults with T1DM using insulin pump therapy.
This cross-sectional study used a web survey to collect data on Saudi adults with T1DM who were treated in the specialized insulin pump clinic at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and General Anxiety Disorder-7 scales to measure depression and anxiety.
Of the 70 patients who received the survey, 65 completed it. Overall, 23.1% and 29.2% of the patients reported moderate to severe and mild depression, respectively; 18.5% and 24.6% reported moderate to severe and mild anxiety, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown, adherence to a healthy diet and regular physical activity decreased in 67.7% and 41.5% of the patients, respectively. Most patients maintained their adherence to insulin pump behaviors; frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose increased in 47% of glucometer users. Most patients benefited from phone visits or virtual education sessions, but 66.2% of the patients reported difficulty obtaining at least one type of insulin pump supply.
Promoting self-management behaviors and psychological wellbeing of patients with T1DM using insulin pump therapy is crucial during a lockdown. Telemedicine is a useful alternative to in-person appointments, but strategies to ensure that patients have access to adequate resources during lockdown must be developed.

Glycaemia and utilisation of technology across the lifespan of adults with type 1 diabetes: results of the Australian National Diabetes Audit (ANDA).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33310120/),"
To evaluate the utilisation of technologies and associated glycaemia among adults with type 1 diabetes.
De-identified data from adults with type 1 diabetes (≥18 years old) in the Australian National Diabetes Audit (ANDA)-2019 were analysed. Proportions using insulin pumps or injections with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) or capillary-glucose testing were compared. Technology use among adults was compared to young people (<21 years old) with subsidised CGM. Glycaemia and complication-burden were assessed across management strategies.
1,693 adults were analysed. Mean(±SD) age, diabetes duration, and HbA1c were 43.3±17.0 years, 20.3±14.3 years and 8.4%±1.7 [68±19mmol/mol], respectively. Among adults, 40% used at least one device, 27% used insulin pumps, and 23% used CGM. CGM was used by 62% of young people with subsidised access. Mean HbA1c was consistently lower among adults using CGM, insulin pumps, or combined insulin pump and CGM compared to standard care (8.3%±1.6 [67±18mmol/mol], 8.2%±1.4 [66±15mmol/mol], and 7.8%±1.4 [62±15mmol/mol] respectively compared to 8.6%±1.8 [70±20mmol/mol], p<0.001). Technology use was not associated with diabetic ketoacidosis but CGM was associated with more hypoglycaemia.
Government subsidy is an important consideration for utilisation of technologies among adults with type 1 diabetes. Technology use across the adult lifespan was associated with lower HbA1c than insulin injections and capillary-glucose testing.

Association of family structure with type 1 diabetes management and outcomes in adolescents: a population-based cross-sectional survey.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33259124/),"
Diabetes therapies have enormously changed during past decades, but only few studies have analyzed the association between family structure and diabetes management and outcomes.
To analyze cross-sectionally the associations of family structure with type 1 diabetes (T1D) management and various diabetes outcomes.
1,635 11- to 17-year-old participants and their parents completed one of three baseline surveys as part of a nationwide, population-based cohort study on early-onset, long-standing T1D. Associations between family structure and outcome variables were analyzed by multivariable linear/logistic regression.
Compared to adolescents living with both parents (reference), HbA1c was 0.48% (95% confidence interval 0.24; 0.71) / 5.2 (2.6; 7.8) mmol/mol higher in adolescents living with one parent and 0.34% (0.08; 0.59) / 3.7 (0.9; 6.5) mmol/mol higher in those living with one parent and her/his partner. The blood glucose self-monitoring (SMBG) frequency was lower (single parent: -0.6 (-1.1; -0.2), parent and partner:-0.5 (-1.0; 0.0)) and parents reported more long-term consequences related to school or work (ORsingle-parent 1.52 (0.90; 2.57), ORparent+partner 1.50 (0.86; 2.60)). While living with one parent was associated with increased odds of insulin injection vs. insulin pump therapy (OR 1.61 (1.13; 2.29), the odds of low hypoglycemia awareness (OR 1.75 (1.00; 3.08)) and diabetes complications (1.32 (0.78; 2.22)) were higher in people living with a parent and her/his partner.
Living with only one parent with or without a new partner was associated with less SMBG and pump use and poor diabetes outcomes. Future studies to explore the underlying mechanisms are required. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

"Use of insulin pump therapy is associated with reduced hospital-days in the long-term: a real-world study of 48,756 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33258970/),"
In pediatric diabetes, insulin pump therapy is associated with less acute complications but inpatient pump education may lead to more hospital days. We investigated the number of hospital days associated with pump vs. injection therapy between 2009 and 2018 in 48,756 patients with type 1 diabetes < 20 years of age from the German Diabetes Prospective Follow-up Registry (DPV). Analyses were performed separately for hospitalizations at diagnosis (hierarchical linear models adjusted for sex, age, and migration), and for hospitalizations in the subsequent course of the disease (hierarchical Poisson models stratified by sex, age, migration, and therapy switch). At diagnosis, the length of hospital stay was longer with pump therapy than with injection therapy (mean estimate with 95% CI: 13.6 [13.3-13.9] days vs. 12.8 [12.5-13.1] days, P < 0.0001), whereas during the whole follow-up beyond diagnosis, the number of hospital days per person-year (/PY) was higher with injection therapy than with pump therapy (4.4 [4.1-4.8] vs. 3.9 [3.6-4.2] days/PY), especially for children under 5 years of age (4.9 [4.4-5.6] vs. 3.5 [3.1-3.9] days/PY).Conclusions: Even in countries with hospitalizations at diabetes diagnosis of longer duration, the use of pump therapy is associated with a reduced number of hospital days in the long-term. What is known: • In pediatric diabetes, insulin pump therapy is associated with better glycemic control and less acute complications compared with injection therapy. • However, pump therapy implies more costs and resources for education and management. What is new: • Even in countries where pump education is predominantly given in an inpatient setting, the use of pump therapy is associated with a reduced number of hospital days in the long-term. • Lower rates of hospitalization due to acute complications during the course of the disease counterbalance longer hospitalizations due to initial pump education.

"Early versus delayed insulin pump therapy in children with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes: results from the multicentre, prospective diabetes follow-up DPV registry.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33253630/),"
Although continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (ie, insulin pump therapy) is associated with improved metabolic control compared with multiple daily insulin injections in children with type 1 diabetes, it is unclear when it is best to start it after diagnosis. In this study, we aimed to compare the outcomes between early and delayed start of insulin pump therapy in young patients with type 1 diabetes.
We based the current study on data from the multicentre, prospective diabetes follow-up registry (ie, Diabetes-Patienten-Verlaufsdokumentation [DPV]). The DPV registry comprises 501 diabetes centres from Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. We included patients diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 2004 and 2014, who were aged between 6 months and 15 years at the time of diagnosis, who had started insulin pump therapy either within the first 6 months (ie, the early treatment group) or in the second to third year (ie, the delayed treatment group) after diabetes diagnosis, and who were treated with insulin pump therapy for at least 1 year. The outcome parameters included the glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values, the cardiovascular risk profile, and rates of acute complications and diabetes-associated hospital admissions (ie, hospitalisation) during the most recent documented treatment year with insulin pump therapy. Statistical models were adjusted for age at diabetes diagnosis, year of diagnosis, sex, immigrant background, use of continuous glucose monitoring, centre size, and the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation 2012 terciles.
Our study sample comprised 8332 patients from 311 diabetes centres in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. The early treatment group consisted of 4004 (48·1%) of 8332 patients, and the delayed treatment group consisted of 4328 (51·9%). The median diabetes duration during follow-up was 6·7 years (IQR 5·1-8·7 in the early group; 5·0-8·7 in the delayed group) in both groups. Patients with early initiation of insulin pump therapy compared with those with delayed initiation of insulin pump therapy had significantly lower estimated mean HbA1c values (7·9% [95% CI 7·8-7·9] and 62·6 mmol/mol [95% CI 62·1-63·2] vs 8·0% [8·0-8·1] and 64·1 mmol/mol [63·6-64·6]; p=0·0006), and lower rates of hypoglycaemic coma (incidence risk ratio 0·44 [95% CI 0·24-0·79]; p=0·0064) and hospitalisation (0·86 [95% CI 0·78-0·94]; p=0·0016). A better cardiovascular risk profile was observed in patients with early initiation of insulin pump therapy than in those with delayed initiation: an estimated mean systolic blood pressure of 117·6 mm Hg (95% CI 117·2-117·9) versus 118·5 mm Hg (118·2-118·9), p=0·0007; and HDL cholesterol of 62·8 mg/dL (95% CI 62·2-63·5) versus 60·6 mg/dL (60·0-61·2), p<0·0001; however, diastolic blood pressure; concentrations of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides; and estimated body-mass index standard deviation scores during follow-up did not differ significantly between both groups.
Our findings provide evidence for improved clinical outcomes associated with the early initiation of insulin pump therapy in children with type 1 diabetes.

Prediction of Individual Basal Rate Profiles From Patient Characteristics in Type 1 Diabetes on Insulin Pump Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33251851/),"
Basal rate profiles in patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy are subject to enormous inter-individual heterogeneity. Tools to predict basal rates based on clinical characteristics may facilitate insulin pump therapy.
Data from 339 consecutive in-patients with adult type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy were collected. Basal rate tests were performed over 24 hours. A mathematical algorithm to predict individual basal rate profiles was generated by relating the individual insulin demand to selected clinical characteristics in an exploratory cohort of 170 patients. The predicted insulin pump profiles were validated in a confirmatory cohort of 169 patients.
Basal rates (0.27 ± 0.01 IU.d-1.kg-1) showed circadian variations with peaks corresponding to the ""dawn"" and ""dusk"" phenomena. Age, gender, duration of pump treatment, body-mass-index, HbA1c, and triacylglycerol concentrations largely predicted the individual basal insulin demand per day (IU/d; exploratory vs prospective cohorts: r2 = 0.518, P < .0001). Model-predicted and actual basal insulin rates were not different (exploratory cohort: Δ 0.1 (95% CI -0.9; 1.0 U/d; P = .95; prospective cohort: Δ -0.5 (95% CI -1.5; 0.6 IU/d; P = .46). Similarly, precise predictions were possible for each hour of the day. Actual and predicted ""dawn"" index correlated significantly in the exploratory but not in the confirmatory cohort.
Clinical characteristics predict 52% of the variation in individual basal rate profiles, including their diurnal fluctuations. The multivariate regression model can be used to initiate or optimize insulin pump treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Fear of hypoglycemia in children with type 1 diabetes and their parents: Effect of pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring with option of low glucose suspend in the CGM TIME trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33179818/),"
To determine if pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring offering low glucose suspend (LGS) decreases fear of hypoglycemia among children with type 1 diabetes and their parents. The CGM TIME trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that enrolled 144 children with type 1 diabetes for at least 1 year (mean duration 3.4 ± 3.1 years) starting pump therapy (MiniMed™ Veo™, Medtronic Canada). CGM (MiniMed™ Enlite™ sensor) offering LGS was introduced simultaneously or delayed for 6 months. Hypoglycemia Fear Scale (HFS) was completed by children ≥10 years old and all parents, at study entry and 12 months later. Simultaneous and Delayed Group participants were combined for all analyses. Subscale scores were compared with paired t-tests, and individual items with paired Wilcoxon tests. Linear regression examined association with CGM adherence. 121/140 parents and 91/99 children ≥10 years had complete data. Mean Behavior subscale score decreased from 21.1 (SD 5.9) to 17.2 (SD 6.1) (p < .001) for children, and 20.7 (SD 7.5) to 17.4 (7.4) (p < .001) for parents. Mean Worry subscale score decreased from 17.9 (SD 11.9) to 11.9 (SD 11.4) (p < .001) for children, and 23.1 (SD 13.2) to 17.6 (SD 10.4) (p < .001) for parents. Median scores for 10/25 child items and 12/25 parent items were significantly lower at 12 months (p < .001). Linear regression found no association between HFS scores and CGM adherence. Insulin pump therapy with CGM offering LGS significantly reduced fear of hypoglycemia not related to CGM adherence in children with type 1 diabetes and their parents.

Insulin Edema With Use of U-500 Regular Insulin in a Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33178538/),"
Insulin edema is a rare complication of insulin therapy which has been described in known or newly diagnosed people with diabetes, following initiation or intensification of insulin treatment. Here we present a 63-year-old man with complaints of weight gain, shortness of breath, and lower extremity edema starting two weeks after the change of his insulin pump to the hybrid closed-loop insulin pump system and substitution of U-100 aspart insulin with U-500 regular insulin. Laboratory studies, imaging, and electrocardiogram (EKG) were performed to evaluate the cause of acute edema and were all normal. Hemoglobin A1C showed remarkable improvement after the pump change and the insulin pump download showed a significant increase in the amount of total daily insulin administered. With the exclusion of other causes of acute edema, the patient was diagnosed with insulin edema. He was started on spironolactone 50 mg/daily and showed a desirable improvement of edema on follow-up.  This case shows that although the use of the hybrid insulin-pump system helps to obtain better control of diabetes in many patients, the rapid improvement in glycemic control may precipitate the development of insulin edema. Furthermore, the use of high concentration insulin in insulin pumps is off-label and their use might increase the rate of complications of insulin therapy including insulin edema.

"Glycemic, maternal and neonatal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes using continuous glucose monitoring during pregnancy - pump vs multiple daily injections, a secondary analysis of an observational cohort study.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33176006/),"
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) provides detailed information about glucose level fluctuations over time. The method is increasingly being used in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. However, only one previous study has compared CGM results related to pregnancy outcomes in women using insulin pumps with those administering multiple daily injections (MDI). We performed a secondary analysis of CGM metrics from an observational cohort of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and compared insulin pump and MDI therapies in relation to maternal and neonatal outcomes.
The study included 185 pregnant Swedish women with type 1 diabetes undergoing CGM throughout pregnancy. Women were divided according to insulin administration mode, ie MDI (n=131) or pump (n=54). A total of 91 women used real-time CGM and 94 women used intermittently viewed CGM. Maternal demographics and maternal and neonatal outcome data were collected from medical records. CGM data were analyzed according to predefined glycemic indices: mean glucose; standard deviation; percentage of time within, below and above glucose target range; mean amplitude of glycemic excursion; high and low glucose indices and coefficient variation in percent. Associations between insulin administration mode and CGM data, on the one hand, and maternal and neonatal outcomes, on the other, were analyzed with analysis of covariance and logistic regression, respectively, adjusted for confounders.
There were no differences in maternal characteristics or glycemic indices between the MDI and pump groups, except longer duration of type 1 diabetes and higher frequencies of microangiopathy and eal-time CGM among pump users. Despite improvement with each trimester, glucose levels remained suboptimal throughout pregnancy in both groups. There were no differences between the MDI and pump groups concerning the respective associations with any of the outcomes. The frequency of large for gestational age was high in both groups (MDI 49% vs pump 63%) and did not differ significantly.
Pregnant women with type 1 diabetes did not differ, in glycemic control or pregnancy outcome, related to MDI or pump administration of insulin. Glycemic control remained suboptimal throughout pregnancy, regardless of insulin administration mode.

Racial-Ethnic Disparities in Diabetes Technology Use Among Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33155826/),"

Background:
 Recent studies highlight racial-ethnic disparities in insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D), but drivers of disparities remain poorly understood beyond socioeconomic status (SES). 
Methods:
 We recruited a diverse sample of young adults (YA) with T1D from six diabetes centers across the United States, enrolling equal numbers of non-Hispanic (NH) White, NH Black, and Hispanic YA. We used multivariate logistic regression to examine to what extent SES, demographics, health care factors (care setting, clinic attendance), and diabetes self-management (diabetes numeracy, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and Self-Care Inventory score) explained insulin pump and CGM use in each racial-ethnic group. 
Results:
 We recruited 300 YA with T1D, aged 18-28 years. Fifty-two percent were publicly insured, and the mean hemoglobin A1c was 9.5%. Large racial-ethnic disparities in insulin pump and CGM use existed: 72% and 71% for NH White, 40% and 37% for Hispanic, and 18% and 28% for NH Black, respectively. After multiple adjustment, insulin pump and CGM use remained disparate: 61% and 53% for NH White, 49% and 58% for Hispanic, and 20 and 31% for NH Black, respectively. 
Conclusions:
 Insulin pump and CGM use was the lowest in NH Black, intermediate in Hispanic, and highest in NH White YA with T1D. SES was not the sole driver of disparities nor did additional demographic, health care, or diabetes-specific factors fully explain disparities, especially between NH Black and White YA. Future work should examine how minority YA preferences, provider implicit bias, systemic racism, and mistrust of medical systems help to explain disparities in diabetes technology use.

Youth and non-European ethnicity are associated with increased loss of publicly funded insulin pump access in New Zealand people with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33131079/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been publicly funded in New Zealand for people living with type 1 diabetes since 2012. The aim of the current study was to investigate the loss of access, once obtained, to public-funded CSII. The frequency and socio-demographics of access, and loss, to CSII spanning the period 2012 to 2018 were examined.
Nationally held data collections including the New Zealand Virtual Diabetes Register were used to calculate the overall and subgroup proportions using and ceasing CSII. A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios for pump use for the predictor variables (sex, age group, ethnicity and deprivation index) and to calculate odds ratios for pump cessation for the same demographic factors.
Once CSII access is obtained, approximately 4% per year cease CSII in a subsequent year. This cessation of publicly funded CSII was not distributed equally among the population, showing over-representation in youth (aged 10-29 years) and non-Europeans, in particular Māori and Pasifika. Compounding this, it remains less likely for people with diabetes to initially access publicly funded CSII in New Zealand if they are non-European and more socio-economically deprived.
In New Zealand, Māori and Pasifika, as well as youth, are over-represented in the cessation of CSII in comparison with Europeans and all other age groups. These groups are also less likely to gain initial access to public funding. Efforts to understand and reduce these disparities are needed, including review of current public funding access criteria.

Insulin Pump Therapy Improves Quality of Life of Young Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Enrolled in a Government-Funded Insulin Pump Program: A Qualitative Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33109446/),"
The Nova Scotia Insulin Pump Program (NSIPP) subsidizes the cost of insulin pump therapy for young patients (≤25 years) with type 1 diabetes. The first NSIPP evaluation focused on clinical outcomes rather than quality of life. Existing research on insulin pumps and quality of life is mostly survey based, with limited first-voice experiences. In this qualitative study, we examined patient and parent perspectives on how insulin pumps affect quality of life in the context of a government-funded program.
In this investigation, we used a phenomenological approach, guided by a conceptual model. In-depth semistructured telephone interviews (median, 37 minutes) were completed with NSIPP enrollees and/or their parents. Saturation was reached after 23 interviews. Verbatim transcripts were coded independently by 2 researchers. Coding discrepancies were discussed and resolved using concept mapping to clarify relationships between codes and to identify main themes.
There were 2 main themes: 1) NSIPP financial support was necessary for those without private insurance and 2) control over life and diabetes with subthemes of social experiences and worry. Participants expressed this theme differently depending on their stage of life. For example, some children experienced shame and even hid their pump, whereas teens were more self-confident with the discreetness of pumps and young adults wore their pump with pride.
Insulin pump therapy, subsidized through the NSIPP, led to improved quality of life, which was experienced differently depending on stage of life.

Adjustment of Insulin Pump Settings in Type 1 Diabetes Management: Advisor Pro Device Compared to Physicians' Recommendations.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33100030/),"
To compare insulin dose adjustments made by physicians to those made by an artificial intelligence-based decision support system, the Advisor Pro, in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using an insulin pump and self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG).
This was a multinational, non-interventional study surveying 17 physicians from 11 countries. Each physician was asked to provide insulin dose adjustments for the settings of the pump including basal rate, carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios (CRs), and correction factors (CFs) for 15 data sets of pumps and SMBG of people with T1D (mean age 18.4 ± 4.8 years; eight females; mean glycated hemoglobin 8.2% ± 1.4% [66 ± 11mmol/mol]). The recommendations were compared among the physicians and between the physicians and the Advisor Pro. The study endpoint was the percentage of comparison points for which there was an agreement on the direction of insulin dose adjustments.
The percentage (mean ± SD) of agreement among the physicians on the direction of insulin pump dose adjustments was 51.8% ± 9.2%, 54.2% ± 6.4%, and 49.8% ± 11.6% for the basal, CR, and CF, respectively. The automated recommendations of the Advisor Pro on the direction of insulin dose adjustments were comparable )49.5% ± 6.4%, 55.3% ± 8.7%, and 47.6% ± 14.4% for the basal rate, CR, and CF, respectively( and noninferior to those provided by physicians. The mean absolute difference in magnitude of change between physicians was 17.1% ± 13.1%, 14.6% ± 8.4%, and 23.9% ± 18.6% for the basal, CR, and CF, respectively, and comparable to the Advisor Pro 11.7% ± 9.7%, 10.1% ± 4.5%, and 25.5% ± 19.5%, respectively, significant for basal and CR.
Considerable differences in the recommendations for changes in insulin dosing were observed among physicians. Since automated recommendations by the Advisor Pro were similar to those given by physicians, it could be considered a useful tool to manage T1D.

Timing of CGM initiation in pediatric diabetes: The CGM TIME Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33098212/),"
To determine whether timing of CGM initiation offering low glucose suspend (LGS) affects CGM adherence in children and youth starting insulin pump therapy.
A 5-site RCT of pump-naïve subjects (aged 5-18 years) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) for at least 1 year compared simultaneous pump and CGM initiation offering LGS vs standard pump therapy with CGM initiation delayed for 6 months. Primary outcome was CGM adherence (hours per 28 days) (MiniMed™ Paradigm™ Veo™ system; CareLink Pro™ software) over 6 months after CGM initiation. Secondary outcome HbA1c was measured centrally. Linear mixed-models and ordinary least squares models were fitted to estimate effect of intervention, and covariates baseline age, T1D duration, HbA1c, gender, ethnicity, hypoglycemia history, clinical site, and association between CGM adherence and HbA1c.
The trial randomized 144/152 (95%) eligible subjects. Baseline mean age was 11.5 ± 3.3(SD) years, T1D duration 3.4 ± 3.1 years, and HbA1c 7.9 ± 0.9%. Six months after CGM initiation, adjusted mean difference in CGM adherence was 62.4 hours per 28 days greater in the Simultaneous Group compared to Delayed Group (P = .007). There was no difference in mean HbA1c at 6 months. However, for each 100 hours of CGM use per 28-day period, HbA1c was 0.39% (95% CI 0.10%-0.69%) lower. Higher CGM adherence was associated with reduced time with glucose >10 mmol/L (P < .001).
CGM adherence was higher after 6 months when initiated at same time as pump therapy compared to starting CGM 6 months after pump therapy. Greater CGM adherence was associated with improved HbA1c.

Quality of Life in Children With Diabetes Treated With Insulin Pump Compared With Multiple Daily Injections in Tertiary Care Center.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33088186/),"
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) have been widely used as options in treating diabetes in childhood. Glycemic control is important to reduce diabetes complications; however, more focus needs to be on patients' Quality of Life (QoL). Diabetes and QoL have strong associations in terms of patients' overall health including their psychology, physical well-being, compliance with medication. A previous systematic review stressed that strong evidence to deny or prove the benefits of insulin pump therapy on health-related quality of life is deficient. The aim of this study is to assess the health-related quality of life and the psychological impacts of children with diabetes who use CSII and MDI treatment.
A cross-sectional study included 68 pediatric patients with type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) who were treated in a tertiary center in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. We used the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 3.0 Diabetes Module and this module assesses the health-related quality of life of children with diabetes.
Thirty-four (50%) participants found to be on MDI, of which 21 (61.8%) are males, compared to 34 (50%) patients using CSII, of which 12 (35.2%) are females. Participants using CSII had statistically significant better symptom control, less treatment difficulties but were more worrisome than MDI participants.
CSII group had better quality of life in almost all aspects even though they were more worrisome. Further studies with a larger sample size are needed to give comprehensive generalizations.

"""Finding the Balance"": A Qualitative Study of the Experience of Nurses and Patients with Diabetes on an Insulin Pump in the Hospital.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33063643/),"
The purpose of this study was to explore experiences of hospitalized patients as they transition insulin pump self-management from home to hospital and the experience of nurses caring for them. Patients are often more knowledgeable about the pump than their nurses, which could lead to undiscovered challenges. Little is known about the hospital experience related to insulin pump therapy from nurses' and patients' perspectives.
A qualitative approach with interpretive descriptive design and purposive sampling was used. Eligible patients were ≥18 years of age, able to read and speak English, and admitted to non-ICU settings ≥20 hours. Eligible nurses cared for at least 1 patient using an insulin pump. Patients and nurses were interviewed separately. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using a constant comparative method. Coding was performed independently and jointly to reach consensus on emerging themes.
Hospitalized patients and nurses had an array of perceptions highlighting challenges and adaption to ""finding the balance"" in managing diabetes when patients wore their insulin pumps. There were 4 interrelated themes representing a continuum of trust to lack of trust, control versus lack of control, effective communication to limited communication, and staff knowledge to lack of knowledge.
Results of this study provide valuable insights into the challenges for both patients and nurses. A standardized approach to caring for this population is necessary. These findings can inform the development of nursing education programs and policies aimed at improving their experiences.

"Six Months of Hybrid Closed-Loop Versus Manual Insulin Delivery With Fingerprick Blood Glucose Monitoring in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: A Randomized, Controlled Trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33055139/),"
To investigate glycemic and psychosocial outcomes with hybrid closed-loop (HCL) versus user-determined insulin dosing with multiple daily injections (MDI) or insulin pump (i.e., standard therapy for most adults with type 1 diabetes).
Adults with type 1 diabetes using MDI or insulin pump without continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were randomized to 26 weeks of HCL (Medtronic 670G) or continuation of current therapy. The primary outcome was masked CGM time in range (TIR; 70-180 mg/dL) during the final 3 weeks.
Participants were randomized to HCL (n = 61) or control (n = 59). Baseline mean (SD) age was 44.2 (11.7) years, HbA1c was 7.4% (0.9%) (57 [10] mmol/mol), 53% were women, and 51% used MDI. HCL TIR increased from (baseline) 55% (13%) to (26 weeks) 70% (10%) with the control group unchanged: (baseline) 55% (12%) and (26 weeks) 55% (13%) (difference 15% [95% CI 11, 19]; P < 0.0001). For HCL, HbA1c was lower (median [95% CI] difference -0.4% [-0.6, -0.2]; -4 mmol/mol [-7, -2]; P < 0.0001) and diabetes-specific positive well-being was higher (difference 1.2 [95% CI 0.4, 1.9]; P < 0.0048) without a deterioration in diabetes distress, perceived sleep quality, or cognition. Seventeen (9 device-related) versus 13 serious adverse events occurred in the HCL and control groups, respectively.
In adults with type 1 diabetes, 26 weeks of HCL improved TIR, HbA1c, and their sense of satisfaction from managing their diabetes compared with those continuing with user-determined insulin dosing and self-monitoring of blood glucose. For most people living with type 1 diabetes globally, this trial demonstrates that HCL is feasible, acceptable, and advantageous.

Safety and feasibility of the PEPPER adaptive bolus advisor and safety system; a randomized control study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33048581/),"
<b>Background:</b> The Patient Empowerment through Predictive Personalised Decision Support (PEPPER) system provides personalised bolus advice for people with Type 1 diabetes. The system incorporates an adaptive insulin recommender system (based on case-based reasoning, an artificial intelligence methodology), coupled with a safety system which includes predictive glucose alerts and alarms, predictive low-glucose suspend, personalised carbohydrate recommendations and dynamic bolus insulin constraint. We evaluated the safety and feasibility of the PEPPER system compared to a standard bolus calculator. <b>Methods:</b> This was an open-labelled multicentre randomized controlled cross-over study. Following 4-week run-in, participants were randomized to PEPPER/Control or Control/PEPPER in a 1:1 ratio for 12-weeks. Participants then crossed over after a wash-out period. The primary end-point was percentage time in range (TIR, 3.9mmol/L-10.0mmol/L (70-180mg/dL)). Secondary outcomes included glycaemic variability, quality of life, and outcomes on the safety system and insulin recommender. <b>Results:</b> 54 participants on multiple daily injections (MDI) or insulin pump completed the run-in period, making up the intention-to-treat analysis. Median (interquartile range) age was 41.5 (32.3-49.8) years, diabetes duration 21.0 (11.5-26.0) years and HbA1c 61.0 (58.0-66.1) mmol/mol. No significant difference was observed for percentage TIR between the PEPPER and Control groups (62.5 (52.1-67.8) % vs 58.4 (49.6-64.3) % respectively, p=0.27). For quality of life, participants reported higher perceived hypoglycaemia with the PEPPER system despite no objective difference in time spent in hypoglycaemia. <b><b>Conclusions:</b></b> The PEPPER system was safe but did not change glycaemic outcomes, compared to control. There is wide scope for integrating PEPPER into routine diabetes management for pump and MDI users. Further studies are required to confirm overall effectiveness.

"Revision of Alberta's Provincial Insulin Pump Therapy Criteria for Adults and Children With Type 1 Diabetes: Process, Rationale and Framework for Evaluation.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33046399/),"
Insulin pump therapy is a valuable, but costly approach, with public funding in Alberta for eligible individuals since 2013. The Provincial Insulin Pump Therapy Program Clinical Advisory Committee has revised and updated the clinical criteria, integrating current literature, best practice and feedback from clinicians. The objective was to develop criteria that would: 1) optimize safety and effectiveness of insulin pump therapy, while 2) carefully stewarding resources available to care for people with type 1 diabetes.
The Clinical Advisory Committee comprised health-care professionals with expertise in pump therapy and included adult and pediatric endocrinologists, an internist, a pediatrician, certified pump trainers, diabetes educators and clinic managers. The group meets regularly by teleconference. Decisions are made by consensus.
Indications for insulin pump therapy for adults and children with insulin-deficient diabetes were divided into 4 hierarchical levels: 1) problematic hypoglycemia, inability to achieve acceptable control or progressive complications; 2) unpredictable activity, dawn phenomenon or children for whom use of multiple daily injections is not appropriate; 3) individual preference and 4) clinical exception, with priority given to indications with clear evidence of benefit. The criteria emphasize the importance of: 1) adequate education in diabetes self-management; 2) adequate trial of flexible insulin therapy with modern analogues and 3) evidence of active, safe diabetes self-management. Tools to facilitate effective and efficient annual review and surveillance were developed incorporating biological, behavioural evaluation and self-reflection to provide a framework for program evaluation. The recommendations were implemented in January 2019.
The process and revised criteria may be valuable for jurisdictions considering how to develop and implement a publicly funded insulin pump program.

Glucose Control During Physical Activity and Exercise Using Closed Loop Technology in Adults and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33011134/),"
Guidelines for safe exercise strategies exist for both pediatric and adult patients living with type 1 diabetes. The management of type 1 diabetes during exercise is complex, but making insulin dosing adjustments in advance of activity can yield positive outcomes and reduce the likelihood of hypoglycemia. Closed loop (also known as automated insulin delivery) systems are able to partially automate insulin delivery and can assist in exercise and overall management of type 1 diabetes. Current exercise guidelines, however, focus primarily on management strategies for patients using multiple daily injections or open loop insulin pump therapy. Closed loop systems require strategic approaches to type 1 diabetes management, including appropriate timing and duration of exercise targets and carbohydrates around exercise that have yet to be standardized. This review aims to showcase how closed loop technology has evolved over the last decade and summarizes a number of closed loop and exercise studies both in free-living conditions and clinical trials. This review also highlights strategies and approaches for exercise and type 1 diabetes management using closed loop systems. Some differences in closed loop strategies for exercise include the importance of pump suspension if disconnecting during exercise, fewer grams of uncovered carbohydrates before exercise and these should be taken close to exercise onset to avoid a rise in automated insulin delivery. A primary goal for future closed loop systems is to detect exercise without user input, so that patients are not required to preset exercise targets well in advance of activity, as are the current recommendations.

Education programmes for persons with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump: A systematic review.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33010190/),"
Education is essential in insulin pump therapy, but literature in the field is limited. We systematically reviewed insulin pump education programmes and their effects in two situations as follows: (1) basic education at the start of insulin pump therapy, providing the study design enabled us to separate the effects of insulin pump therapy itself from the effects of education and (2) re-education of experienced pump users. Population: individuals ≥16 years with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps with or without continuous glucose monitoring. Systematic searches were run in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and ERIC. Original studies reporting an effect of insulin pump education programmes were included if published in English between January 1999 and May 2019. Of 988 potentially relevant studies, 48 were assessed in full text. Nine studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including one randomised controlled trial. Educational approaches and settings were sparsely described in all studies, and the content was usually reported as teaching points. Two studies considered basic education, reporting evaluations of knowledge and application skills, and programme satisfaction. The remaining seven studies referred to re-education. Two studies measured severe hypoglycaemic events before and after a re-education intervention, both reporting a significant event reduction. HbA1c decreased significantly in three of four studies. Two studies reported increased knowledge and improved application skills. In conclusion, this review indicates benefits from basic education and from re-education. The strength of the conclusions is limited by the low number of studies and study designs. High-quality studies are needed comparing different approaches for insulin pump education.

Performance of an Automated Insulin Delivery System: Results of Early Phase Feasibility Studies.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32940537/),"

Background:
 Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have demonstrated improvements in time-in-range (TIR, blood glucose 70-180 mg/dL) without increasing hypoglycemia. Testing a closed-loop system in an inpatient environment with supervised challenges allows for initial evaluation of performance and safety of the system. 
Methods:
 Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) were enrolled into two similar studies (n = 10 per study), with 3-day inpatient analysis periods. Participants tested a Lilly hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system comprising an investigational insulin pump, insulin lispro, a pump-embedded model predictive control algorithm, a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and an external dedicated controller. Each protocol included meal-related and exercise challenges to simulate real-world diabetes self-management errors. Only study staff interacted with the HCL system. Performance was assessed using standard CGM metrics overall and within prespecified periods. 
Results:
 Participants (25% male) had mean ± standard deviation (SD) age 44.7 ± 14.2 years, T1D duration 30.2 ± 11.1 years, A1C 7.2% ± 0.8%, and insulin usage 0.53 ± 0.21 U/(kg·day). Percentage TIR 70-180 mg/dL (mean ± SD) was 81.2 ± 8.4 overall, 85.2 ± 8.1 outside of challenge periods, 97.3 ± 5.3 during the nocturnal periods, and 74.5 ± 16.2 for the postprandial periods. During challenge periods, percentage TIR for the overbolus challenge was 65.4 ± 29.2 and that for the delayed bolus challenge was 57.1 ± 25.1. No adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, or unanticipated adverse device events occurred while participants were using the HCL system. 
Conclusions:
 In participants with T1D, Lilly AID system demonstrated expected algorithm performance and safety with satisfactory glycemic outcomes overall and in response to simulated diabetes management challenges. Additional studies in less supervised conditions and with broader patient populations are warranted. ClinicalTrials.gov Registration number NCT03743285, NCT03849612.

Insulin dose optimization using an automated artificial intelligence-based decision support system in youths with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32908282/),"
Despite the increasing adoption of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices, most people with type 1 diabetes do not achieve their glycemic goals1. This could be related to a lack of expertise or inadequate time for clinicians to analyze complex sensor-augmented pump data. We tested whether frequent insulin dose adjustments guided by an automated artificial intelligence-based decision support system (AI-DSS) is as effective and safe as those guided by physicians in controlling glucose levels. ADVICE4U was a six-month, multicenter, multinational, parallel, randomized controlled, non-inferiority trial in 108 participants with type 1 diabetes, aged 10-21 years and using insulin pump therapy (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT03003806). Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive remote insulin dose adjustment every three weeks guided by either an AI-DSS, (AI-DSS arm, n = 54) or by physicians (physician arm, n = 54). The results for the primary efficacy measure-the percentage of time spent within the target glucose range (70-180 mg dl-1 (3.9-10.0 mmol l-1))-in the AI-DSS arm were statistically non-inferior to those in the physician arm (50.2 ± 11.1% versus 51.6 ± 11.3%, respectively, P < 1 × 10-7). The percentage of readings below 54 mg dl-1 (<3.0 mmol l-1) within the AI-DSS arm was statistically non-inferior to that in the physician arm (1.3 ± 1.4% versus 1.0 ± 0.9%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Three severe adverse events related to diabetes (two severe hypoglycemia, one diabetic ketoacidosis) were reported in the physician arm and none in the AI-DSS arm. In conclusion, use of an automated decision support tool for optimizing insulin pump settings was non-inferior to intensive insulin titration provided by physicians from specialized academic diabetes centers.

Insulin Pump Use in Children with Type 1 Diabetes: Over a Decade of Disparities.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32889433/),"
Racial disparities have been shown in outcomes and treatment of children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The purpose of this study was to examine temporal trends in insulin pump use among non-Hispanic white (NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic children attending a large urban diabetes center. . This study was a retrospective chart review of insulin pump usage by race (NHW/ NHB) in 2005, and race/ethnicity (NHW/NHB/Hispanic) in 2011-2019. Demographic data (age, sex, diabetes duration, SES) and most recent hemoglobin A1c were also abstracted in 2011-2019.
In 2005, NHW children were twice as likely to use an insulin pump as NHB children. From 2011 to 2019, the odds ratio increased to 2.5 for NHW compared to NHB children. The odds of Hispanic children using insulin pumps were also higher than NHB. Insurance status (government versus private), a surrogate for SES, had very little influence on these trends, with NHW children consistently more likely than NHB children to be treated with insulin pumps in 2011, 2013, 2017, 2019 (p < 0.001).
We have demonstrated that racial disparities in insulin pump use have persisted over the past 15 years, and are not determined by SES. This inequity in diabetes treatment may be playing a role in the poorer glycemic control and higher rates of diabetes complications in NHB children.
Healthcare providers should be cognizant of racial and ethnic disparities in the treatment of children with T1D. Standardized treatment protocols may reduce unconscious bias in prescribing.

Comparison of Insulin Pump Bolus Calculators Reveals Wide Variation in Dose Recommendations.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32869656/),"
The introduction of insulin pumps with bolus calculators (BCs) has improved glycemic outcomes and quality of life for those with type 1 diabetes. Despite the increased reliance on BCs, the formulas used to derive recommended boluses are not standardized. Our objective was to examine whether recommendations from different pump BCs vary significantly for identical clinical scenarios.
Three commercially available insulin pump BCs were programmed with identical settings and then presented with combinations of blood glucose (BG) and carbohydrates (CHOs) to generate a 4-unit bolus. At one- and two-hour time points, while there was insulin-on-board (IOB) present, we simulated various BG and CHO scenarios in order to compare BC-recommended doses.
Differences in suggested doses were noted between BCs, as well as within the same brand. The greatest variation was apparent when BG was below target. Doses suggested by one BC varied depending on whether the IOB resulted from a previous dose given for BG or CHO, while the other two BCs adjusted for total IOB regardless of the source.
In this simulation study, there were large differences in recommended doses between BCs due to the unique way each manufacturer incorporates IOB into their formulas as well as the pharmacokinetics used to derive the IOB amount. Providers should be aware that identical pump settings will result in a different dose recommendation for each pump brand and advise patients accordingly.

Sensor-augmented pumps with predictive low glucose suspend function (PLGS-SAP) help patients avoid hypoglycemia and improve quality of life: in this retrospective study, we investigated long-term effects of PLGS-SAP on metabolic outcomes, acute and chronic diabetic complications, in particular cardiovascular events.
One hundred thirty-nine adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) treated for more than 10 years with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) were followed for 5 years; 71 (Group 1) started to use PLGS-SAP, and 68 (Group 2) maintained on their non-PLGM insulin pump. Glucose control measures (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c], acute diabetic complications), clinical outcomes (body mass index [BMI], arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia), chronic diabetes-related complications, and device utilization (continuous glucose monitoring utilization, use of temporary basal rates or special boluses, carbohydrate counting usage) were assessed.
The reduction of HbA1c was significant in Group 1 (from 7.5% ± 1.1% to 7.0% ± 1.0%, P = .02), while in Group 2 it did not reach statistical significance (from 7.5% ± 1.1% to 7.4% ± 0.9%, P = .853). BMI increased significantly in Group 2 (from 25.3 ± 2.8 to 25.7 ± 3.4, P < .001), but not in Group 1 (from 25.2 ± 3.5 to 25.2 ± 2.8, P = .887). There were no statistically significant differences in occurrence of acute diabetes complications, other clinical outcomes, prevalence of diabetes-related complications, or device utilization between the groups.
In our five-year follow-up experience with T1D CSII users, PLGS-SAP has resulted efficient in improving metabolic control and maintaining the body weight.

Evening and overnight closed-loop control versus 24/7 continuous closed-loop control for type 1 diabetes: a randomised crossover trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32864597/),"
Automated closed-loop control (CLC), known as the ""artificial pancreas"" is emerging as a treatment option for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), generally superior to sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) treatment. It is postulated that evening-night (E-N) CLC may account for most of the benefits of 24-7 CLC; however, a direct comparison has not been done.
In this trial (NCT02679287), adults with T1D were randomised 1:1 to two groups, which followed different sequences of four 8-week sessions, resulting in two crossover designs comparing SAP vs E-N CLC and E-N CLC vs 24-7 CLC, respectively. Eligibility: T1D for at least 1 year, using an insulin pump for at least six months, ages 18 years or older. Primary hypothesis: E-N CLC compared to SAP will decrease percent time <70mg/dL (3.9mmol/L) measured by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) without deterioration in HbA1c. Secondary Hypotheses: 24-7 CLC compared to SAP will increase CGM-measured time in target range (TIR, 70-180mg/dL; 3.9-10mmol/L) and will reduce glucose variability during the day.
Ninety-three participants were randomised and 80 were included in the analysis, ages 18-69 years; HbA1c levels 5.4-10.6%; 66% female. Compared to SAP, E-N CLC reduced overall time <70mg/dL from 4.0% to 2.2% () resulting in an absolute difference of 1.8% (95%CI: 1.2-2.4%), p<0.0001. This was accompanied by overall reduction in HbA1c from 7.4% at baseline to 7.1% at the end of study, resulting in an absolute difference of 0.3% (95% CI: 0.1-0.4%), p<0.0001. There were 5 severe hypoglycaemia adverse events attributed to user-directed boluses without malfunction of the investigational device, and no diabetic ketoacidosis events.
In type 1 diabetes, evening-night closed-loop control was superior to sensor-augmented pump therapy, achieving most of the glycaemic benefits of 24-7 closed-loop.

The t:slim X2™ insulin pump with Control-IQ™ technology, an advanced hybrid closed-loop system, became available in the United States in early 2020. Real-world outcomes with use of this system have not yet been comprehensively reported.
Individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) (≥14 years of age) who had ≥21 days of pump usage data were invited via email to participate. Participants completed psychosocial questionnaires (Technology Acceptance Scale [TAS], well-being index [WHO-5], and Diabetes Impact and Devices Satisfaction [DIDS] scale) at timepoint 1 (T1) (at least 3 weeks after starting Control-IQ technology) and the DIDS and WHO-5 at timepoint 2 (T2) (4 weeks from T1). PROs and glycemic outcomes were reviewed at each timepoint.
Overall, 9,085 potentially eligible individuals received the study invite. Of these, 3,116 consented and subsequently 1,435 participants completed questionnaires at both T1 and T2 and had corresponding glycemic data available on the t:connect® web application. TIR was 78.2% (70.2-85.1%) at T1 and 79.2% (70.3-86.2%) at T2. PROs reflected high device-related satisfaction and reduced diabetes impact at T2. Factors contributing to high trust in the system included sensor accuracy, improved diabetes control, reduction in extreme blood glucose levels, and improved sleep quality. In addition, participants reported improved quality of life, ease of use, and efficient connectivity to the CGM as being valuable features of the system.
Continued real-world use of the t:slim X2 pump with Control-IQ technology showed improvements in psychosocial outcomes and persistent achievement of recommended time-in-range glycemic outcomes in people with T1D.

A clinical review of the t:slim X2 insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32842794/),"
Insulin pumps are commonly used for intensive insulin therapy to treat type 1 diabetes in adults and youth. Insulin pump technologies have advanced dramatically in the last several years to integrate with continuous glucose monitors (CGM) and incorporate control algorithms. These control algorithms automate some insulin delivery in response to the glucose information received from the CGM to reduce the occurrence of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and improve overall glycemic control. The t:slim X2 insulin pump system became commercially available in 2016. It is an innovative insulin pump technology that can be updated remotely by the user to install new software onto the pump device as new technologies become available. Currently, the t:slim X2 pairs with the Dexcom G6 CGM and there are two advanced software options available: Basal-IQ, which is a predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) technology, and Control-IQ, which is a Hybrid Closed Loop (HCL) technology. This paper will describe the different types of advanced insulin pump technologies, review how the t:slim X2 insulin pump works, and summarize the clinical studies leading to FDA approval and commercialization of the Basal-IQ and Control-IQ technologies.

Commercialised automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have demonstrated improved outcomes in type 1 diabetes (T1D), however, they have limited capacity for algorithm individualisation, and can be prohibitively expensive if an individual is without access to health insurance or health funding subsidy. Freely available open-source algorithms, which have the ability to individualise algorithm parameters paired with commercial insulin pumps, and continuous glucose monitoring make up the so-called ""do it yourself"" (DIY) approach to AID. Limited data on the open-source approach have shown promising results, but data from a large randomised control trial are lacking.
The CREATE (Community deRivEd AutomaTEd insulin delivery) trial is an open-labelled, randomised, parallel 24-week, multi-site trial comparing sensor augmented pump therapy (SAPT) to our AnyDANA-loop. The three components of AnyDANA-loop are: 1) OpenAPS algorithm implemented in a smartphone (a version of AndroidAPS), 2) DANA-i™ insulin pump and, 3) Dexcom G6R continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The primary outcome measure is the percentage of time in target sensor glucose range (3.9 -10mmol/L). Secondary outcomes include psycho-social factors and platform performance. Analysis of online collective learning, characteristic of the open-source approach, is planned. 100 participants with T1D aged 7 - 70 years (age stratified into children/adolescents 7-15 years and adults 16-70 years), will be recruited from four sites in New Zealand. A 24-week continuation phase follows, to assess long-term safety.

Glycemic Control and Hypoglycemia in Patients Treated with Insulin Pump Therapy: An Observational Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32832557/),"
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. It has been associated with an important morbimortality due to its complications and sometimes as a result of adverse events related to treatment. Insulin pump therapy (IPT) is one of the options used to control this disease and reduces one of the most frequent complication associated with treatment: hypoglycemia, which has also a great impact on life quality and clinical status of patients.
A descriptive and retrospective study was performed including patients treated and followed by the department of endocrinology from a high-complexity university hospital in Cali, Colombia, between 2012 and 2017. Patients were on IPT and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM): MiniMed Paradigm® Veo™ Insulin Pump (Medtronic®) and MiniMed 640G Insulin Pump-Enlite™ Sensor (Medtronic®). Presentation of hypoglycemia and variables associated with its development were evaluated.
51 patients were included. The main indication for IPT initiation was the report of hypoglycemic episodes and inappropriate metabolic control. Initiation of IPT was related with a decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and also a decrease in severe hypoglycemic events and hospitalization due to hypoglycemia. The risk factors linked with clinically significant hypoglycemia were male gender, and standard deviation of glucose measures calculated by CGM. A diminished glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) was correlated with higher risk of severe hypoglycemia.
IPT with CGM is a useful strategy in the management of patients with DM; it is associated with a reduction of adverse hypoglycemic events and hospitalizations due to hypoglycemia.

Model-Based Detection and Classification of Insulin Pump Faults and Missed Meal Announcements in Artificial Pancreas Systems for Type 1 Diabetes Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32746034/),"
The artificial pancreas (AP) is an innovative closed-loop system for type 1 diabetes therapy, in which insulin is infused by portable pumps and insulin dosage is modulated by a control algorithm on the basis of the measurements collected by continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors. AP systems safety and effectiveness could be affected by several technological and user-related issues, among which insulin pump faults and missed meal announcements. This work proposes an algorithm to detect in real-time these two types of failure.
The algorithm works as follows. First, a personalized autoregressive moving-average model with exogenous inputs is identified using historical data of the patient. Second, the algorithm is used in real time to predict future CGM values. Then, alarms are triggered when the difference between predicted vs measured CGM values is higher than opportunely set thresholds. In addition, by using two different set of parameters, the algorithm is able to distinguish the two types of failures. The algorithm was developed and assessed in silico using the latest version of the FDA-approved Padova/UVa T1D simulator.
The algorithm showed a sensitivity of ~81.3% on average when detecting insulin pump faults with ~0.15 false positives per day on average. Missed meal announcements were detected with a sensitivity of ~86.7% and 0.13 FP/day.
The presented method is able to detect insulin pump faults and missed meal announcements in silico, correctly distinguishing one from another.
The method increases the safety of AP systems by providing prompt alarms to the diabetic subject and effectively discriminating pump malfunctioning from user errors.

Coronavirus lockdown effect on type 1 diabetes management οn children wearing insulin pump equipped with continuous glucose monitoring system.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32650036/),"
On the 10th of March, Greece imposed the closure of schools and universities and a full lockdown a few days later in order to counter the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Our aim was to monitor the effect of the coronavirus lockdown in diabetes management in children with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) wearing insulin pump equipped with continuous glucose monitoring system.
In 34 children with T1DM on Medtronic 640G insulin pump equipped with the Enlite Sensor uploaded CareLink data were categorized in 2 three-week periods before and after the 10th of March.
Mean time in range (TIR) did not significantly differ between the two periods. However, a significantly higher Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicating an increased glucose variability in the pre-lockdown period was observed (39.52% versus 37.40%, p = 0.011). Blood glucose readings were significantly fewer during the lockdown period (7.91 versus 7.41, p = 0.001). No significant difference was recorded regarding the total daily dose of insulin and the reported carbohydrates consumed. However, the meal schedule has changed dramatically as the percentage of breakfast consumed before 10.00 a.m. has fallen from 80.67% to 41.46% (p < 0.001) during the lockdown. Correspondingly, the percentage of dinner consumption before 10.00 p.m. significantly fell during the lockdown period (60.22% versus 53.78%, p = 0.019).
Glycemic control during the coronavirus lockdown can be adequately achieved and be comparable to the pre-lockdown period in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus wearing insulin pump equipped with sensor.

Compatibility and Safety of Ultra Rapid Lispro with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes: PRONTO-Pump Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32640842/),"

Background:
 Ultra rapid lispro (URLi) is a new insulin lispro formulation that has accelerated absorption and improved postprandial glucose control compared with insulin lispro (Humalog®). The compatibility and safety of URLi versus lispro were evaluated in patients with type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump). 
Methods:
 In this phase 3, double-blind, crossover study, 49 patients were randomized to two 6-week treatment periods, after a 2-week lead-in period on lispro. The primary endpoint was the rate of infusion set failures due to a pump occlusion alarm, or unexplained hyperglycemia with blood glucose >13.9 mmol/L (250 mg/dL) that did not decrease within 1 h after a correction bolus. 
Results:
 There was no significant difference in the rate of infusion set failures between URLi and lispro (0.03 vs. 0.05 events/30 days, P = 0.375). A higher rate of premature infusion set changes was observed with URLi (1.13 vs. 0.78 events/30 days; P = 0.028), translating to one additional infusion set change approximately every 3 months. A trend toward improved glycemic control was observed with URLi treatment: Time in range 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (71-180 mg/dL) was 65.7% ± 1.3% versus 63.0% ± 1.3%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 46.9% of patients on URLi treatment and 18.8% on lispro. This difference was driven by an increase in infusion site reactions-more than 90% were mild. Incidence of all other TEAEs and severe hypoglycemia was similar between treatments. 
Conclusions:
 URLi was compatible with insulin pump use with a safety profile similar to lispro.

Psychosocial factors associated with HbA1c in adults with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes: a systematic review.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32579748/),"
To identify currently available studies on the association between psychosocial factors and HbA1c in adults with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes, by performing a systematic review of the literature.
MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and PsycINFO were searched for original studies on the association between psychosocial factors and HbA1c in ≥ 50 adult, non-pregnant, insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes.
The search resulted in 1777 unique records, of which eight were eligible for inclusion. All identified studies were observational, with sample sizes ranging from 51 to 214. Seven different psychosocial factors were investigated in the eight studies. Study analysis suggested that HbA1c may be associated with diabetes numeracy and quality of life. There were no indications of associations between HbA1c and fear of hypoglycaemia or self-efficacy. Results regarding associations between HbA1c and coping style, diabetes distress and locus of control were inconsistent.
This systematic review summarizes the currently limited information on the association between psychosocial factors and HbA1c during insulin pump therapy. The evidence base of the included studies was weak, and this review highlights the need for more research in these areas, with improved methodological and theoretical frameworks, including exploration of a broader spectrum of psychosocial variables and their potential association with HbA1c and other metabolic outcomes.

Individualization of recommendations from the international consensus on continuous glucose monitoring-derived metrics in Japanese children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32565500/),"
We assessed the significance of recommendations from the international consensus on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-derived metrics in Japanese children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Eighty-five patients (age, 13.5 ± 4.7 years) who wore the FreeStyle® Libre for a 28-day period were enrolled in this study. Seventy-three patients were treated with multiple daily injections of insulin and 12 with insulin pump therapy without using a sensor-augmented pump or a predictive low-glucose suspend-function pump. We evaluated the relationship between CGM-derived metrics: time in range (TIR: 70-180 mg/dL), time below range (TBR: <70 mg/dL), and time above range (TAR: >180 mg/dL), and laboratory-measured HbA1c and estimated HbA1c (eA1c) levels calculated from the mean glucose values. The TIR was 50.7 ± 12.2% (23-75%), TBR was 11.8 ± 5.8% (2-27%), and TAR was 37.5 ± 13.5% (9-69%). The TIR was highly correlated with HbA1c level, eA1c level, and TAR, but not with TBR. An HbA1c level of 7.0% corresponded to a TIR of 55.1% (95% CI: 53.7-56.5%), whereas a TIR of 70% corresponded to an HbA1c level of 6.1% (95% CI: 5.9-6.3%). The results of eA1c levels were similar to those observed for HbA1c levels. From these findings, we conclude that low rates of a recommended TIR of 70% may be due to less use of advanced technology and insufficient comprehensive diabetes care. Ethnic characteristics including lifestyle and eating customs may have contributed to the result. CGM-derived targets must be individualized based on ethnic characteristics, insulin treatment and diabetes care, and needs of individuals with diabetes.

"Age, male gender, and social deprivation, are associated with a lower rate of insulin pump therapy initiation in adults with type 1 diabetes: a population-based study.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32522046/),"
The objective of this population-based study was to identify factors associated with insulin pump therapy initiation in adults with insulin-requiring diabetes in France in 2015.
People with insulin-requiring diabetes and their characteristics were identified from the national health data system. Factors associated with insulin pump therapy initiation were identified by logistic regression analysis.
The study focused on 614,913 adults with diabetes treated by multiple daily injections before 2015: 4,083 of them initiated insulin pump therapy during the year (71% of them had type 1 diabetes, T1D). Factors associated with insulin pump therapy initiation were the number of consultations with an endocrinologist within the last two years (2 vs 0, OR = 1.5, p < 0.01), the presence of a chronic cardiovascular or neurovascular disease (OR = 1.6 for T1D, OR = 1.3 for T2D, p < 0.01) and treatment with antidepressants/anxiolytics (OR = 1.2 for T1D, OR = 1.4 for T2D, p < 0.01). The other determinants were female gender (OR= 1.5, p < 0.01) and history of hospitalisation for acute metabolic complications (OR= 1.14, p < 0.01) in T1D. Factors associated with less insulin pump therapy initiation were age, duration of diabetes, end-stage renal disease and social deprivation (OR=0.662, p<0.01, T1D only).
Predictive factors of insulin pump therapy initiation in people with insulin-requiring diabetes in 2015 in France were globally consistent with clinical practice guidelines. Age, male gender, and social deprivation, are still associated with a lower rate of insulin pump therapy initiation in adults with T1D.

Pumps that predict and manage low blood glucose are superior to pumps with stand-alone CGM for reducing hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetes patients in a real-world setting.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32497708/),"
This study aimed to assess the efficacy of insulin pumps with automated predictive low-glucose insulin suspension in a real-world setting compared with stand-alone flash glucose monitoring (FGM).
The data analyzed were uploaded by patients with type 1 diabetes (n=195) treated with external insulin pumps [either a MiniMed 640G system (Medtronic) including SmartGuard technology that predicts and manages low glucose (n=61) or an Omnipod patch pump accompanied by a FreeStyle Libre sensor (Abbott) for FGM (n=134)].
The median (25th-75th percentile) time spent with sensor glucose values≤3.9mmol/L was 0.9% (0.4-1.55) vs. 5.6% (3.05-9.55) in the predictive low-glucose suspend group vs. FGM users, respectively (P<0.0001), with similar results obtained for median time spent with sensor glucose values≤3mmol/L (P<0.0001). The group using sensor-integrated pumps had lower % coefficient of variation (CV) values and lower mean amplitude glycaemic excursions (P<0.0001). Mean glucose values as well as measured HbA1c levels were also lower.
These real-world data show that predictive low-glucose insulin suspension is more effective than pumps with stand-alone FGM for reducing hypoglycaemic events, and could be of benefit to patients at risk of hypoglycaemia as well as those lacking in hypoglycaemic awareness.

Insulin pump technologies are advancing rapidly, with new insulin pumps becoming available every year offering improvements in glycemic control. School nurses must understand the basics of insulin pump therapy and distinguish between advanced pump technologies to best support their students with T1D. This is the second article in a three-part series on the use of technology in managing diabetes in youth. The first article described continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and provided tips for the school nurses in incorporating CGM into the student's individualized healthcare plan. The purpose of this article is to summarize insulin pump technologies, from conventional insulin pump therapy to advanced automated insulin delivery systems and to describe keys to success with insulin pump technologies. Part 3 will focus on special considerations and problem solving related to technology use in the school setting.

Continuous rhPTH (1-34) treatment in chronic hypoparathyroidism.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32478671/),"
Standard treatment of hypoparathyroidism consists of supplementation of calcium and vitamin D analogues, which does not fully restore calcium homeostasis. In some patients, hypoparathyroidism is refractory to standard treatment with persistent low serum calcium levels and associated clinical complications. Here, we report on three patients (58-year-old male, 52-year-old female, and 48-year-old female) suffering from severe treatment-refractory postsurgical hypoparathyroidism. Two patients had persistent hypocalcemia despite oral treatment with up to 4 µg calcitriol and up to 4 g calcium per day necessitating additional i.v. administration of calcium gluconate 2-3 times per week, whereas the third patient presented with high frequencies of hypocalcemic and treatment-associated hypercalcemic episodes. S.c. administration of rhPTH (1-34) twice daily (40 µg/day) or rhPTH (1-84) (100 µg/day) only temporarily increased serum calcium levels but did not lead to long-term stabilization. In all three cases, treatment with rhPTH (1-34) as continuous s.c. infusion via insulin pump was initiated. Normalization of serum calcium and serum phosphate levels was observed within 1 week at daily 1-34 parathyroid hormone doses of 15 µg to 29.4 µg. Oral vitamin D and calcium treatment could be stopped or reduced and regular i.v. calcium administration was no more necessary. Ongoing efficacy of this treatment has been documented for up to 7 years so far. Therefore, we conclude that hypoparathyroidism that is refractory to both conventional treatment and s.c. parathyroid hormone (single or twice daily) may be successfully treated with continuous parathyroid hormone administration via insulin pump.
Standard treatment of hypoparathyroidism still consists of administration of calcium and active vitamin D. Very few patients with hypoparathyroidism also do not respond sufficiently to standard treatment or administration of s.c. parathyroid hormone once or twice daily. In those cases, continuous s.c. administration of parathyroid hormone via insulin pump may represent a successful treatment alternative.

A Facilitated Web-Based Self-Management Tool for People With Type 1 Diabetes Using an Insulin Pump: Intervention Development Using the Behavior Change Wheel and Theoretical Domains Framework.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32356776/),"
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) requires intensive self-management (SM). An insulin pump is designed to better support personal T1D management, but at the same time, it exacerbates the complexity and requirements of SM. Research shows that people with diabetes are likely to benefit from navigating and connecting to local means of social support and resources through web-based interventions that offer flexible, innovative, and accessible SM. However, questions remain as to which behavior change mechanisms within such resources benefit patients most and how to foster engagement with and endorsement of SM interventions.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the perspectives and experiences of people with T1D using an insulin pump and specialist health care professionals (HCPs) and determine what behavior change characteristics and strategies are required to inform the optimization of an existing web-based social network (SN) intervention to support SM.
Focus groups with insulin pump users (n=19) and specialist HCPs (n=20) in 6 National Health Service (NHS) trusts across the south of England examined the barriers and enablers to incorporating and self-managing an insulin pump. An analysis was undertaken using the Behavior Change Wheel and Theoretical Domains Framework, followed by a taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) to identify the contents of and strategies for the implementation of a complex health intervention.
A total of 4 themes represent the SM perspectives and experiences of stakeholders: (1) a desire for access to tailored and appropriate resources and information-the support and information required for successful SM are situational and contextual, and these vary according to time and life circumstances, and therefore, these need to be tailored and appropriate; (2) specific social support preferences-taking away isolation as well as providing shared learnings and practical tips, but limitations included the fear of judgment from others and self-pity from peers; (3) the environmental context, that is, capacity and knowledge of pump clinic HCPs-HCPs acknowledge the patient's need for holistic support but lack confidence in providing it; and (4) professional responsibility and associated risks and dangers, whereas HCPs are fearful of the consequences of promoting non-NHSSM support, and they question whether SM support fits into their role. BCTs were identified to address these issues.
The use of behavioral theory and a validated implementation framework provided a comprehensive approach for systematically identifying barriers and enablers of self-managing T1D with an insulin pump. A web-based SN intervention appears to offer additional forms of SM support while complementing NHS services. However, for intervention implementation, HCPs' apprehensions about responsibility when signposting to non-NHS SM support would need to be addressed, and opportunistic features would need to be added, through which pump users could actively engage with other people living with T1D.

Impact of insulin pump therapy on glycemic control among adult Saudi type-1 diabetic patients. An interview-based case-control study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32318460/),"
Diabetes is associated with several potential preventable complications like the efficacy of insulin pump over multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) in glycemic control.
To assess the outcomes of insulin pump as compared to insulin injection therapy.
Case-control study conducted among adult type-1 diabetic patients using insulin pump therapy and alternative insulin injection therapy from the University Diabetes Center (UDC), King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during 1st June-30th October, 2017.
Interview-based questionnaires were used on of 200 subjects using insulin therapy and control (conventional and MDI). Results of each were compared.
t-test was used for continuous variables and Chi-square test was used for categorical variables. P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Patients on pump therapy showed a non-significant higher mean of hypoglycemic episodes per week and a lower mean of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episodes per year as compared to the injection therapy patients 1.97 vs. 1.77 and 0.35 vs. 0.37, respectively. However, statistically significant differences were found between the pump and MDI, the pump and conventional, and the MDI and conventional when HbA1c levels were tested.
Among adult patients with type-1 diabetes, insulin pump as compared to insulin injection was associated with better glycemic control. However, for acute complications, non-significant higher mean of hypoglycemic episodes per week and a lower mean of DKA episodes per year were reported in pump therapy as compared to the injection therapy patients.

We explored the impact of TeKnO T1D, an online, case-based, spaced education curriculum about insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use in pediatric type 1 diabetes management.
Pediatric endocrinology fellows (n = 64) were randomized to receive an educational curriculum focused on either insulin pumps or CGMs. Fellows received interactive questions twice weekly via email or mobile app. Median time to completion was 76.5 days. The primary outcome was change in knowledge as measured by performance on multiple-choice questions (MCQ) from the pre-test to the post-test.
Forty-eight of 64 (75%) learners completed the curriculum and assessments. The pump group improved from 35.0 ± 15% on the pre-test MCQs to 61.1 ± 17% on the post-test, a 12.2 absolute percentage point greater improvement on pump-specific items than the CGM group (P = .03). The CGM group improved from 30.3 ± 15% on the pre-test MCQs to 61.4 ± 21% on the post-test, a 28.7 absolute percentage point greater improvement on CGM-specific items than the pump group (P < .001). Both groups were more likely to report an appropriate level of understanding of their respective technologies after completing the corresponding curriculum. In thematic analysis of qualitative data, fellows indicated that knowledge gains led to improved patient care. There was universal agreement about enjoyment and effectiveness of the curricula.
TeKnO T1D proved to be an engaging, effective way to improve endocrinology fellows' knowledge and confidence about insulin pumps and CGM use in the management of pediatric type 1 diabetes.

Glycaemic control across the lifespan in a cohort of New Zealand patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32175657/),"
It is well known that tight glycaemic control reduces all-cause mortality and the development of microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D), but that effective glycaemic control is difficult to achieve in different age groups. Currently, the state of glycaemic control across the lifespan in patients with T1D in New Zealand is not known. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the differences in glycaemic control with age, gender, rurality and ethnicity in patients with T1D in the Waikato region of New Zealand.
Retrospective review of clinical records of all patients with T1D on the Waikato Regional Diabetes Database in December 2017 (n = 1303). Glycaemic control was determined by the most recent HbA1c in the last two years.
Median (25%,75%) HbA1c was 67 (59,81) mmol/mol (8.3%) and highest in those aged 15-29 years. Values exceeded clinical recommendations in 85.3% of all patients. Median HbA1c was lower in patients on insulin pump therapy than on multiple daily injections (63 (7.9%) versus 69 mmol/mol (8.5%); P < 0.001), though insulin pumps were significantly less likely to be used by MĀori (P = 0.003) and men (P < 0.0001). Worsening glycaemic control was associated with increasing social deprivation (p < 0.001) but was not influenced by rural/urban living.
Poor glycaemic control in Waikato patients with T1D is likely due to inequities in health care, including reduced access to insulin pump therapy, particularly in MĀori and socially deprived populations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

A Prospective Study of Insulin Infusion Set Use for up to 7 Days: Early Replacement Reasons and Impact on Glycemic Control.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32167382/),"

Background:
 There is limited evidence supporting a replacement interval of infusion sets for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The aim of this study was to investigate if steel and soft cannula infusion sets can be used in CSII therapy for up to 7 days without negative impact on infusion sites or glycemic control. 
Methods:
 The insulin infusion sets YpsoPump® Orbit®micro (steel needle) and YpsoPump® Orbit®soft (soft cannula) were each used for up to 7 days by 40 adult subjects with CSII. Each subject used both infusion set types twice. Early replacement reasons were documented and glycemic control was monitored. 
Results:
 Of 160 inserted insulin infusion sets, 66% were used for 7 days with no obvious difference between steel and soft infusion sets. The mean wearing time was 6.2 ± 1.5 days. Main reasons for early infusion set replacements were occlusions (19%), plaster issues (4%), and accidental pull-out (4%). Comparing glycemic control during day 1-3 and 1-7, mean glucose was 146 ± 21 mg/dL versus 148 ± 18 mg/dL, coefficient of variation was 34% ± 7% versus 33% ± 5%, and insulin dose was 40 ± 11 U versus 41 ± 11 U. Only mild and nonserious infusion site reactions occurred. 
Conclusions:
 In this study, 7 days indwelling time of insulin infusion sets did not show a clinically relevant impact on glycemic control or insulin requirements and the infectious risk appeared to be low. The replacement interval of infusion sets may be individualized beyond the currently labeled maximum use duration.

"Cost, Hassle, and On-Body Experience: Barriers to Diabetes Device Use in Adolescents and Potential Intervention Targets.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32163719/),"

Background:
 Adolescents with diabetes have the highest A1cs of all age groups. Diabetes devices (insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors [CGM]) can improve glycemic outcomes, and although the uptake of devices has increased, they remain underutilized in this population. This study characterizes adolescent-reported barriers to diabetes device use to determine targets for clinician intervention. 
Methods:
 We surveyed 411 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (mean age 16.30 ± 2.25 years) on barriers to diabetes device use, technology use attitudes (general and diabetes specific), benefits and burdens of CGM, self-efficacy for diabetes care, diabetes distress, family conflict, and depression. We characterize barriers to device uptake; assess demographic and psychosocial differences in device users, discontinuers, and nonusers; and determine differences in device use by gender and age. 
Results:
 The majority of adolescents used an insulin pump (n = 307, 75%) and more than half used CGM (n = 225, 55%). Cost/insurance-related concerns were the most commonly endorsed barrier category (61%) followed by wear-related issues (58.6%), which include the hassle of wearing the device (38%) and dislike of device on the body (33%). Adolescents who endorsed more barriers also reported more diabetes distress (P = 0.003), family conflict (P = 0.003), and depressive symptoms (P = 0.014). Pump and CGM discontinuers both endorsed more barriers and more negative perceptions of technology than current users, but reported no difference from device users in diabetes distress, family conflict, or depression. Gender was not related to the perceptions of devices. 
Conclusions:
 Clinicians can proactively assess attitudes toward diabetes technology and perceptions of benefits/burdens to encourage device uptake and potentially prevent device discontinuation among adolescents.

Objective: Software updatable insulin pumps, such as the t:slim X2 pump from Tandem Diabetes Care, enable access to new technology as soon as it is commercialized. The remote software update process allows for minimal interruption in therapy compared to purchasing a new pump, however little quantitative data exists on the software update process nor on pre/post therapeutic outcomes. We examined real-world usage and impact of a remote software updatable predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) technology designed to reduce hypoglycemic events in people with insulin-dependent diabetes. Methods: Approximately 15,000 U.S. Tandem pump users remotely updated their t:slim X2 software to Basal-IQ PLGS technology since its commercial release. We performed a retrospective analysis of users who uploaded at least 21 days of pre/post PLGS update usage data to the Tandem t:connect web application between August 28, 2018 and October 21, 2019 (n=6,170). Insulin delivery and sensor-glucose values were analyzed per recent international consensus and ADA guidelines. Software update performance was also assessed. Results: Median software update time was 5.36 minutes. Overall glycemic outcomes for pre and post software update showed a decrease in sensor time <70 mg/dL from 2.14 to 1.18% (-1.01, 95% CI -0.97, -1.05, p<0.001), with overall sensor time 70-180 mg/dL increasing from 57.8 to 58.5% (0.64, 95% CI 0.04, 1.24, p<0.001). These improvements were sustained at 3, 6 and 9 months after the update. Conclusion: Introduction of a software updatable PLGS algorithm for the Tandem t:slim X2 insulin pump resulted in sustained reductions of hypoglycemia.

All Insulin Pumps Are Not Equivalent: A Bench Test Assessment for Several Basal Rates.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32069066/),"

Background and Aims:
 Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is a widely adopted treatment for type 1 diabetes and is a component of an artificial pancreas. CSII accuracy is essential for glycemic control, however, this metric has not been given sufficient study, especially at the range of the lowest basal rates (BRs), which are commonly used in a pediatric population and in closed-loop systems (CLSs). Our study presents accuracy results of four off-the-shelf CSII systems using a new accurate method for CSII system evaluation. 
Materials and Methods:
 The accuracy of four off-the-shelf CSII systems was assessed: Medtronic MiniMed 640G®, Ypsomed YpsoPump®, Insulet Omnipod®, and Tandem t:slim X2®. The assessment was performed using a double-measurement approach through a direct mass flow meter and a time-stamped microgravimetric test bench combined with a Kalman mathematical filter. CSII accuracy was evaluated using mean of dose error. Mean absolute relative difference (MARD) of error was calculated at different observation windows over the whole series of tests. Peakwise insulin deliverance was assessed regarding stroke regularity in terms of frequency and volume. 
Results:
 Mean error values indicate a general tendency to underdeliver with up to -16%. MARD of error shows very wide results for each pump and each BR from 7.4% (2 UI/h) to 61.3% (0.1 UI/h). Peakwise analysis shows several choices for BR adaptation (frequency for Omnipod, volume for Tandem, both for YpsoPump and MiniMed 640G). Precision in interstroke time appears to be better (standard deviation [SD] at 0.1 UI/h: 4.6%-12.9%) than stroke volume precision (SD at 0.1 UI/h 38.3%-46.4%). 
Conclusions:
 The accuracy of four off-the-shelf CSII systems is model and BR dependent. CSII imprecision could be due to a variability in volume and/or frequency of strokes for every pump. Some models appear better adapted for the smallest insulin needs, or for inclusion in a CLS. The clinical implications of these delivery errors on glucose instability must be evaluated.

Efficacy and safety of long-term insulin pump treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes aged over 50 years.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32023570/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy using insulin pumps has become widely used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). This retrospective study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of long-term insulin pump treatment in patients with T1DM aged ≥50 years. The study included patients aged ≥50 years, who had a diagnosis of T1DM based on clinical criteria and/or presence of autoantibodies characteristic of autoimmune diabetes, and had received ≥5 years of recent and uninterrupted treatment with a personal insulin pump. We analyzed records on HbA1c levels across the entire observation period. The cohort comprised 17 patients, of whom 6 (35%) were men and 11 (65%) were women. The mean duration of observation was 6.6 years, during which patients had a mean of 8.4 HbA1c measurements. Mean HbA1c level over the entire observation period was 6.7% (range, 5.3-7.4%). Overall, 11 patients (65%) had mean HbA1c levels at the ADA-recommended target of <7% and 5 patients (29%) had mean HbA1c <6.5%. Mean HbA1c level was significantly lower at the end of the observation period than at the start (6.52% versus 6.91%; difference, -0.39%; p < 0.01), indicating an improvement in glycaemic control over time. On average, patients experienced one level 1 hypoglycaemia episode every 2.4 days. This retrospective analysis of at least 5 years of follow-up of selected patients with T1DM aged ≥50 years at the start of observation, showed that CSII is a safe and effective treatment option in this age group.

Long-term effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus patients: Results of a public healthcare system.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32007441/),"
To evaluate the long-term clinical effect of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients in a regional public healthcare system real-world scenario.
All adult T1DM patients on CSII for ≥10 years subjected to follow-up in the regional Castilla-La Mancha Public Health Service were included. The primary efficacy outcome was the variation in HbA1c during follow-up. Direct patient data were compiled through the web-based Spanish national registry on CSII therapy.
A total of 69 T1DM adult patients were treated with insulin pumps for ≥10 years in our region. The mean age was 45.0±10.5 years, with a T1DM duration of 13.9±8.5 years. The mean duration of CSII therapy was 11.4±2.1 years. The main indications for treatment were high glucose variability (39%), problematic hypoglycemia (26%), and HbA1c >53mmol/mol (7%) on multiple daily injections (20%). Sensor-augmented pump therapy was used by 31% of the patients. Glycosylated hemoglobin did not change during follow-up (58±11mmol/mol vs. 58±11mmol/mol; 7.5±1.0 vs. 7.5±1.0; p=0.66). However, the percentage of patients with at least one episode of severe hypoglycemia during the last year and unnoticed hypoglycemia decreased from 36% to 7% (p=0.006) and from 38% to 32% (p<0.001), respectively. The proportion of subjects with ≥1 episode of diabetic ketoacidosis in the last year decreased from 30% to 6% (p=0.045).
The reduction of severe hypoglycemia without deterioration of glycemic control can be sustained over long-term CSII therapy.

Accuracy assessment of bolus and basal rate delivery of different insulin pump systems used in insulin pump therapy of children and adolescents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32003490/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is commonly used in patients with diabetes. Accurate and reliable delivery by insulin pumps is essential for a safe and effective therapy, particularly when using small doses. In this study, accuracy of bolus and basal rate delivery of various available insulin pumps was evaluated.
In total, 13 insulin pump systems were tested: eight durable pumps with different infusion sets and one patch pump. Based on IEC 60601-2-24, insulin delivery was measured by recording weight gain of a beaker into which insulin was infused by the pumps. Bolus accuracy was determined by individually weighing 25 consecutive 0.1 or 1.0 U boluses and basal rate accuracy was determined during basal rate delivery of 0.1 or 1.0 U/h for 72 hours. For analyses, basal rate delivery was divided into 1-hour windows and deviation from target was calculated.
Regarding different systems, average 0.1 U bolus delivery was -2% to +9% of the intended volume with 53% to 96% of boluses within ±15% of target. During 0.1 U/h basal rate delivery, most pumps showed an initial over-delivery for the first few hours. Three systems reached a total basal rate error <5%; others showed up to +24%. In general, delivery was more accurate when using larger doses.
Considerable differences in insulin delivery accuracy were observed between the tested pumps. In general, when using very low doses, accuracy of insulin delivery is limited in most insulin pumps. This should be considered for CSII therapy in children.

Factors influencing adherence among youth with Type-1-Diabetes Mellitus - the Hungarian case.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31987024/),"
Background & Introduction: Due to the increasing prevalence of type-1-diabetes an increasing number of studies draws investigation draws attention to its psychological effects and long-term consequences. As Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic, non-curable, yet maintanable condition, with the affected children and their families facing a lifelong challenge. Our research focuses on the factors influencing adherence. Methods & Results: The adherence of youth was examined in a sample involving 114 patients treated in the Medical and Health Science Centre at the University of Debrecen by employing a new adherence questionnaire (DAQ abbreviated version, Munkácsi et al, 2019) (DAF 2017; N=114). The influence of socio-demographic variables and those related to the disease (age at the diagnosis, time elapsed since diagnosis, method of treatment, the time elapsed since the use of the pump) were measured by linear regression. Furthermore, the between-group comparisons were made by independent sample t-tests and variance analysis. The investigation was carried out between September 2017 and May 2018. The effect of using insulin pump as therapy is significant and positive (0.36. p=0.045). The adherence of the patients using insulin pump is higher while the effect of the age at the diagnosis has a significantly negative effect (-.247, p=0.035). Thus, earlier detection of the disease may lead to a higher level of adherence. The effects of the socio-demographic variables (gender, family structure, educational level, type of the settlement, owning sibling and birth order) were not significant (p>0.05). Regarding the between-group comparisons, a significant difference could be pointed out concerning the siblings and birth-order as the adherence of the those with siblings was higher (p=0.044). Moreover, concerning insulin pump therapy, the adherence of patients using pump was significantly better (p=0.048). Also, regarding the age of the diagnosis, the adherence of those diagnosed before 12 was seemingly higher (p=0.039). Concerning the other socio-demographical and disease-related variables, no significant differences could be detected. Conclusions: The results suggest that the treatment has an outstanding role in the adherence of the disease. Moreover, the role of the appropriate treatment, living conditions as well as the early diagnosis is relevant.

Insulin pumps use in Greece: Efficacy and safety data from 140 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31954749/),"
The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) regarding glycaemic control and quality of life in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), who were previously treated with multiple daily injections (MDI).
140 patients with T1DM [mean age 33.7 ± 22.1 years; 54 males, 76 females, 10 children; duration of diabetes 19.1 ± 8.4 years; total daily insulin usage while on MDI (IU/day) 57.86 ± 15.32; HbA1c at the beginning of CSII treatment 8.67 ± 1.54%] were included in the study. HbA1c, glucose levels, BMI, severe hypoglycemic and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) episodes were recorded and compared to the data prior to CSII introduction. The evaluation of the quality of life was assessed with a self-questionnaire adjusted from the SF-12 and diabetes quality of life (DQoL) questionnaires.
HbA1c was reduced from 8.67 ± 1.54 to 6.85 ± 0.52% (p < 0.001). This reduction was independent of age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and diabetes duration. Daily insulin requirements were lower at the end of the follow-up (36.40 ± 12.20 IU/day) compared with the needs during enrolment (57.86 ± 15.32 IU/day) (p < 0.001). BMI presented no significant alterations. Ten (10) severe hypoglycemic episodes were recorded but the overall rate was decreased by 71.5% (p < 0.001). Only 3 cases of ketoacidosis were recorded. Quality of life parameters were remarkably improved.
This study provided evidence that CSII treatment was superior to MDI for patients with T1DM in Greece. CSII offered a safe, effective alternative to MDI, while improving glycaemic control, side-effects and quality of life.

"The Efficacy of Technology in Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review, Network Meta-analysis, and Narrative Synthesis.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31904262/),"

Background:
 Existing technologies for type 1 diabetes have not been compared against the full range of alternative devices. Multiple metrics of glycemia and patient-reported outcomes for evaluating technologies also require consideration. We thus conducted a systematic review, network meta-analysis, and narrative synthesis to compare the relative efficacy of available technologies for the management of type 1 diabetes. 
Methods:
 We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and other nonindexed citations, EMBASE, PubMed, All Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews, Web of Science, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and PROSPERO (inception-April 24, 2019). We included RCT â‰¥6 weeks duration comparing technologies for type 1 diabetes management among nonpregnant adults (>18 years of age). Data were extracted using a predefined tool. Primary outcomes were A1c (%), hypoglycemia rates, and quality of life (QoL). We estimated mean difference for A1c and nonsevere hypoglycemia, rate ratio for severe hypoglycemia, and standardized mean difference for QoL in network meta-analysis with random effects. 
Results:
 We identified 16,772 publications, of which 52 eligible studies compared 12 diabetes management technologies comprising 3,975 participants in network meta-analysis. Integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems with low-glucose suspend or hybrid closed-loop algorithms resulted in A1c levels 0.96% (predictive interval [95% PrI] 0.04-1.89) and 0.87% (95% PrI 0.12-1.63) lower than multiple daily injections with either flash glucose monitoring or capillary glucose testing, respectively. In addition, integrated systems had the best ranking for A1c reduction utilizing the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA-96.4). While treatment effects were nonsignificant for many technology comparisons regarding severe hypoglycemia and QoL, simultaneous evaluation of outcomes in cluster analyses as well as narrative synthesis appeared to favor integrated insulin pump and continuous glucose monitors. Overall risk of bias was moderate-high. Certainty of evidence was very low. 
Conclusions:
 Integrated insulin pump and CGM systems with low-glucose suspend or hybrid closed-loop capability appeared best for A1c reduction, composite ranking for A1c and severe hypoglycemia, and possibly QoL. Registration: PROSPERO, number CRD42017077221.

"The effect of DAFNE education, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or both in a population with type 1 diabetes in Scotland.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31872473/),"
To investigate the effect of DAFNE and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in clinical practice.
Within NHS Lothian, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion started in 2004 and DAFNE education began in 2006. We extracted anonymized data from the national database for all those aged > 18 years with type 1 diabetes having a Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating course or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion start date (n = 4617).
In total, 956 persons received DAFNE education, and 505 had received an insulin pump, 208 of whom had DAFNE education followed by insulin pump. Mean (SD) HbA1c before DAFNE education was 68 (15) mmol/mol (8.4% [1.4%]) and 66 (13) mmol/mol (8.2% [1.2%]) before continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. In the year following DAFNE education, the mean fall in within-person HbA1c was 3.8 mmol/mol (95% CI 4.0 to 3.4; 0.3% [0.4% to 0.3%]). Those with the poorest control (HbA1c ≥ 85 mmol/mol [9.9%]) experienced the largest decline (15.7 mmol/mol [1.4%]). Those in the lowest HbA1c band at initiation (< 53 mmol/mmol [7.0%]) experienced a rise. In the year following continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion initiation there was a mean fall in within-person HbA1c of 6.6 mmol/mol (6.8 to 6.4; 0.6% [0.6% to 0.6%]). In those with the poorest control (HbA1c ≥ 85 mmol/mol [9.9%]), the mean fall in HbA1c was 22.2 mmol/mol (23 to 21; 2.0% [2.1% to 1.9%]). Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion effectiveness was not different with or without DAFNE education. The effects of both interventions were sustained over 5 years.
Both DAFNE education and insulin pump therapy had the greatest effect on HbA1c in those with higher baseline values. There was little difference to attained HbA1c when Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating education was introduced before insulin pump therapy.

Human regular U-500 insulin via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injections in adults with type 2 diabetes: The VIVID study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31865633/),"
To compare the safety and efficacy of U500-R delivered by a novel, specifically designed U500-R insulin pump with U-500R delivered by multiple daily injections (MDI).
The phase 3 VIVID study randomized people with type 2 diabetes to U-500R by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or MDI. Participants (aged 18-85 years) had HbA1c ≥7.5% and ≤12.0% and a total daily dose of insulin >200 and ≤600 U/day. After a 2-week transition to three times daily injections of U-500R, participants were treated for 24 weeks with U-500R by CSII or MDI. Treatment arms were compared using mixed model repeated measures analysis.
The study randomized 420 participants (CSII: 209, MDI: 211) with 365 completers. Mean changes from baseline were: HbA1c, -1.27% (-13.9 mmol/mol) with CSII and -0.85% (-9.3 mmol/mol) with MDI (difference - 0.42% [-4.6 mmol/mol], P <0.001); fasting plasma glucose, -33.9 mg/dL (-1.9 mmol/L) with CSII and 1.7 mg/dL (0.09 mmol/L) with MDI (difference - 35.6 mg/dL [-2.0 mmol/L], P <0.001); total daily dose, 2.8 U with CSII and 51.3 U with MDI (P < 0.001). Weight changes and rates of documented symptomatic and severe hypoglycaemia were similar between groups; the CSII group had a higher rate of nocturnal hypoglycaemia.
In type 2 diabetes requiring high doses of insulin, both methods of U-500R delivery lowered HbA1c. However, the CSII group attained greater HbA1c reduction with significantly less insulin. Individualized dose titration will be important to balance glycaemic control with hypoglycaemia risk.

Background:
 The aim was to assess the safety and tolerability of the insulin aspart biosimilar/follow-on product SAR341402 (100 U/mL solution; SAR-Asp) and originator insulin aspart (100 U/mL; NN-Asp; NovoLog®) self-administered through an insulin pump. 
Materials and Methods:
 This randomized, open-label, 2 × 4-week crossover study enrolled 45 adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Participants were randomized 1:1 to the treatment sequence SAR-Asp/NN-Asp or NN-Asp/SAR-Asp. The basal and prandial insulin doses were individually titrated. The primary outcome was the number of participants with at least one infusion set occlusion (infusion set change due to failure-to-correct hyperglycemia [plasma glucose ≥250 mg/dL] by insulin pump bolus) during the 4-week treatment. The main secondary outcome was the number of participants with at least one episode of unexplained hyperglycemia (regardless of correction by an insulin pump bolus without apparent material defect, medical, dietary, insulin dosing reason, or pump problem). 
Results:
 The number of participants reporting ≥1 infusion set occlusion were similar between treatments: 14/43 on SAR-Asp (33 events) and 12/43 on NN-Asp (24 events). The estimated difference in infusion set occlusion risk for SAR-Asp versus NN-Asp was 4.1% (95% confidence interval: -9.3% to 17.4%). The number of participants with ≥1 episode of unexplained hyperglycemia was similar between treatments (31/43 on SAR-Asp [154 events]; 32/43 on NN-Asp [175 events]). Hypoglycemia, treatment-emergent adverse events, hypersensitivity, and injection site reactions were similar between treatments. 
Conclusions:
 SAR-Asp and NN-Asp were well tolerated and had similar infusion set occlusions over a 4-week period in insulin pump users with T1D.

Cost of Treating Skin Problems in Patients with Diabetes Who Use Insulin Pumps and/or Glucose Sensors.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31800294/),"

Background:
 The use of insulin pump and glucose sensor is advantageous, but unfortunately many experience skin problems. To reduce or overcome skin problems, patients use additional products or change their sets preterm. Therefore, the aim was to investigate costs related to skin problems. 
Materials and Methods:
 Two hundred sixty-three patients from four different hospitals in Denmark participated in a cross-sectional survey about skin problems related to insulin pump and/or glucose sensor use. Additional costs aside technology and diabetes treatment were calculated based on adhesives, patches, lotion, and preterm shifts of infusion or sensor sets due to skin problems. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used. 
Results:
 The total costs for all these expenses were 11493.9 U.S. dollars (USD) in 145 pediatric patients and 4843 USD in 118 adult patients. The costs were higher in patients with, than without, skin problems and for skin problems due to the glucose sensor compared with insulin pump. Pediatric patients with eczema and/or wound due to the glucose sensor did cost 154.3 USD more, than patients without these skin problems (P < 0.01). We found a clear dose/response relationship between costs and severity of skin problems, especially in pediatric patients. 
Conclusions:
 Our data show that skin problems due to use of insulin pump and/or glucose sensor have significant costs on the Danish welfare system. This leaves an economic incentive for developing more skin-sensitive adhesive for the infusion set and sensors, at least for a certain subgroup of patients.

"Closed-loop insulin delivery in adults with type 1 diabetes in real-life conditions: a 12-week multicentre, open-label randomised controlled crossover trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33323237/),"
Closed-loop insulin delivery systems are expected to become a standard treatment for patients with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to assess whether the Diabeloop Generation 1 (DBLG1) hybrid closed-loop artificial pancreas system improved glucose control compared with sensor-assisted pump therapy.
In this multicentre, open-label, randomised, crossover trial, we recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with at least a 2 year history of type 1 diabetes, who had been treated with external insulin pump therapy for at least 6 months, had glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of 10% or less (86 mmol/mol), and preserved hypoglycaemia awareness. After a 2-week run-in period, patients were randomly assigned (1:1) with a web-based system in randomly permuted blocks of two, to receive insulin via the hybrid closed-loop system (DBLG1; using a machine-learning-based algorithm) or sensor-assisted pump therapy over 12 weeks of free living, followed by an 8-week washout period and then the other intervention for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of time that the sensor glucose concentration was within the target range (3·9-10·0 mmol/L) during the 12 week study period. Efficacy analyses were done in the modified intention-to-treat population, which included all randomly assigned patients who completed both 12 week treatment periods. Safety analyses were done in all patients who were exposed to either of the two treatments at least once during the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02987556.
Between March 3, 2017, and June 19, 2017, 71 patients were screened, and 68 eligible patients were randomly assigned to the DBLG1 group (n=33) or the sensor-assisted pump therapy group (n=35), of whom five dropped out in the washout period (n=1 pregnancy; n=4 withdrew consent). 63 patients completed both 12 week treatment periods and were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. The proportion of time that the glucose concentration was within the target range was significantly higher in the DBLG1 group (68·5% [SD 9·4] than the sensor-assisted pump group (59·4% [10·2]; mean difference 9·2% [95% CI 6·4 to 11·9]; p<0·0001). Five severe hypoglycaemic episodes occurred in the DBLG1 group and three episodes occurred in the sensor-assisted pump therapy group, which were associated with hardware malfunctions or human error.
The DBLG1 system improves glucose control compared with sensor-assisted insulin pumps. This finding supports the use of closed-loop technology combined with appropriate health care organisation in adults with type 1 diabetes.

Intermittent Fasting Could Be Safely Achieved in People With Type 1 Diabetes Undergoing Structured Education and Advanced Glucose Monitoring.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31866948/),"
Background: Fasting during Ramadan is a form of intermittent fasting in which a person abstains from oral intake between the hours of sunrise and sunset. The fasting month of Ramadan is observed by Muslims worldwide. People with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who choose to fast during Ramadan are at a particularly high risk of acute diabetes complications including hypoglycemia and significant hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that people with uncomplicated T1DM would be able to fast safely during Ramadan following structured education and with daily advanced glucose monitoring. Methods: People with stable and uncomplicated T1DM treated with multiple daily injections (MDIs) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) who chose to fast during Ramadan were recruited for the study. Participants attended Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating (DAFNE) structured education training, and basal insulin was reduced in a controlled fashion. Participants were assigned a sensor-augmented insulin pump or FreeStyle Libre for advanced glucose monitoring. The primary endpoint was the rate of hypoglycemia during Ramadan compared to before Ramadan. Secondary endpoints were percentage time spent <4 mmol/L, >10 mmol/L (range, 4-10 mmol/L), episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and acute kidney injury or hospitalization for any cause. Results: Rates of hypoglycemia were significantly reduced during Ramadan compared with rates before Ramadan (0.53 ± 0. 49 vs. 0.81 ± 0.69 episodes/day, p = 0.0015). No episodes of severe hypoglycemia, DKA, acute kidney injury, or hospitalization occurred during Ramadan period. Percentage time spent >10 mmol/L (46.7 ± 17.7% vs. 42.5 ± 16.4%, p = 0.03) was significantly increased, and percentage time [range, 4-10 mmol/L (48.8 ± 15.9% vs. 50.9 ± 15.9%, p = 0.13)] and percentage time spent <4 mmol/L (4.7 ± 5.4.7% vs. 5.7 ± 6.3%, p = 0.09) were reduced, but these differences were not significant. Conclusions: People with uncomplicated T1DM could safely participate in intermittent fasting similar to Ramadan fasting if equipped with structured education and advanced glucose monitoring systems.

Successful treatment of a cohort of infants with neonatal diabetes using insulin pumps including data on genetics and estimated incidence.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31746017/),"
Neonatal diabetes is rare, and treatment is challenging. We present aspects on treatment, genetics and incidence.
This was a prospective cohort study including all cases in our study area in Sweden. We compared with data from the National Diabetes Registry, the Neonatal Quality Register and the National Patient Register.
In the 19-year study period January 1, 1998 to December 31, 2016, we treated seven infants, five of them boys. Six patients used a subcutaneous insulin pump, and the smallest patient started at a weight of 938 g. Most important was for the pump to deliver minute doses of insulin and the design of cannulas and tubing. All patients could stop insulin treatment at 17-145 days of age. One patient relapsed at age 4.5 years. Four patients used the insulin pump after discharge. A mutation was identified in five patients, and this included all patients born after 30 weeks of gestation. The incidence of neonatal diabetes was 2/1 00 000, higher than previously estimated for Europe. Similar but lower incidences were reported in the registries.
Insulin pumps were safe in neonatal diabetes. All seven cases were transient. Neonatal diabetes was more common in our area than reported from Europe.

Glycemic control outcomes of adults using the MiniMed™ 670G hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system: A single-center study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31733282/),"
MiniMed™ 670G hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pump system offers Auto Mode basal insulin delivery based on patient's sensor glucose readings. The primary outcome of this study is to determine the correlation between Time in Auto Mode and Sensor Glucose Time in Range (SG-TIR) of 70-180 g/dL. Other secondary outcomes focusing on pump behavior characteristics were also assessed.
A retrospective cohort study via chart review was conducted. Adult patients with either type 1 diabetes mellitus or Latent onset Diabetes in Adults (LADA) at an academic medical center endocrinology clinic who were switched to the MiniMed™ 670G HCL System either from multi-dose daily insulin injections (MDII) or another insulin pump with or without a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) were included. Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r) was used to assess the correlation between variables in question within 9 months of switching. The level of statistical significance was set at α < 0.05.
12 patients with average baseline HbA1c of 8.2% (66 mmol/mol) were included. Time in Auto Mode correlated non-significantly but positively with SG-TIR (r = 0.478, p = 0.116). Positive correlations at various degrees were observed for secondary outcomes in question with a statistically significant reduction in HbA1c from baseline (-0.61%, CI 0.25-0.97) (-17 mmol/mol, CI 0.25-0.97) (p = 0.003).
The MiniMed™ 670G HCL system Auto Mode functionality is beneficial for glycemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus or LADA. The overall benefit may vary based on baseline characteristics such as HbA1c.

Improvement of metabolic control after 3-month use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes: a multicenter study in Greece.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31721132/),"
To assess the efficacy of a real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) system added to insulin pump therapy for 3 months, in sub-optimally controlled adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D).
This was a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, post-market release study. A total of 43 adult patients with T1D on insulin pump therapy and inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c > 7.0%) participated in the study. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline HbA1c levels. Secondary objectives were to evaluate the impact of the RT-CGM system on glucose variability, daily insulin requirements, and the frequency of hypoglycemic and ketoacidosis events.
At 3 months, the baseline HbA1c values decreased from 8.0 (7.6, 8.7) to 7.1 (6.7, 8.0) % (p < 0.001). Nineteen participants (44.2%) had a posttreatment HbA1c level â‰¤ 7%. Average total daily insulin requirements, as well as the average number of insulin boluses per day, increased significantly after the use of the RT-CGM system. The number of hypoglycemic events recorded did not differ between the first week and last week of RT-CGM usage, while no severe hypoglycemic episodes, ketoacidosis events, or hospitalizations related to diabetes occurred during the 3-month follow-up period.
Addition of a RT-CGM system to insulin pump therapy for 3 months in inadequately controlled patients with T1D resulted in improved HbA1c levels, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemic events.

Insulin Pumps: Review of Technological Advancement in Diabetes Management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31655714/),"
Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy is an evolving form of insulin delivery which has been shown to be highly effective in maintaining euglycemia and providing patients with flexibility in their lives. It functions by providing the patient with a continuous subcutaneous infusion of a rapid acting insulin and allows the patient to administer boluses throughout the day for food and correction of high glucose levels. CSII is approved in patients with type 1 diabetes and selected patients with type 2 diabetes; however, it is important to select the right patients for pump therapy. Insulin pump technology continues to rapidly evolve, and many options are now on the market, including those that are used in conjunction with continuous glucose monitoring. This review article focuses on the pros and cons of CSII therapy as well as the technical and clinical considerations in starting a patient on this therapy.

A novel exploration of the support needs of people initiating insulin pump therapy using a social network approach: a longitudinal mixed-methods study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31618464/),"
To establish what practical and emotional means of support are required on initiation of insulin pump therapy and how needs change over time, using GENIE, a social network intervention.
The study's longitudinal design used semi-structured interviews, surveys (PAID, CLARKE) and HbA1c values at time of pump initiation, and at 3 and 6 months. Interviews used GENIE to capture participants' expectations and experiences of pump therapy and associated support and resources. Thematic analysis was used with sequential, time-ordered matrices.
A total of 16 adults undertook 47 interviews. A total of 94 services, resources and activities were acquired, while tally, frequency and value of network members increased over time. The novelty of pump therapy impacted on participants' self-management needs. Key themes included: 1) the independent nature of managing diabetes; 2) overcoming the challenges and illness burden associated with pump use; 3) the need for responsive and tailored emotional and practical support; and 4) useful resources when incorporating pump therapy. GENIE was thought to be novel and beneficial.
A social network approach determined what resources and support people with diabetes require when incorporating a new health technology. Visualisation of support networks using concentric circles enabled people to consider and mobilise support and engage in new activities as their needs changed. The novelty of pump therapy creates new illness-related work, but mobilisation of personally valued flexible, tailored support can improve the process of adaptation.

Insulin Pump Settings During Breastfeeding in Women with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31580150/),"

Background:
 We aimed to explore insulin pump settings in breastfeeding women with type 1 diabetes. 
Methods:
 Thirteen unselected breastfeeding women with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy were included consecutively from April 2016 to October 2017. Blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 6 days was applied at 1, 2, and 6 months after delivery. Recommendations were intake of 210 g carbohydrate daily while aiming for glucose target range 4.0-10.0 mmol/L and avoiding hypoglycemia. Immediately after delivery a reduction of total insulin dose by 30% of the prepregnancy dose was recommended. Insulin pump target glucose was 5.8 mmol/L. 
Results:
 Median diabetes duration was 22 (range 13-36) years. At 1, 2, and 6 months, 13, 11, and 8 women, respectively, were breastfeeding and spent ≥70.8% (25%-99%) of time in the glucose target range and ≤3.8% (0%-15.5%) of time with CGM <4.0 mmol/L at night-time and for 24 h. None of the women experienced severe hypoglycemia. HbA1c was 58 (47-72) mmol/mol and 52 (44-60) at 6 months and prepregnancy, respectively, P = 0.18. At 1, 2, and 6 months, the insulin pump settings remained almost stable with basal insulin rates (at 03.00, 08.00, 12.00, and 18.00) 14% lower and the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios 10% higher than the prepregnancy settings. 
Conclusions:
 In breastfeeding women with type 1 diabetes who consumed sufficient amounts of carbohydrates and obtained appropriate glycemic control, the basal insulin rates were 14% lower and carbohydrate-to-insulin ratios 10% higher than before pregnancy. These data are useful when recommending insulin pump settings after delivery.

Predicting Quality of Overnight Glycaemic Control in Type 1 Diabetes Using Binary Classifiers.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31536025/),"
In type 1 diabetes management, maintaining nocturnal blood glucose within target range can be challenging. Although semi-automatic systems to modulate insulin pump delivery, such as low-glucose insulin suspension and the artificial pancreas, are starting to become a reality, their elevated cost and performance below user expectations is hindering their adoption. Hence, a decision support system that helps people with type 1 diabetes, on multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy, to avoid undesirable overnight blood glucose fluctuations (hyper- or hypoglycaemic) is an attractive alternative. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven approach to predict the quality of overnight glycaemic control in people with type 1 diabetes by analyzing commonly gathered data during the day-time period (continuous glucose monitoring data, meal intake and insulin boluses). The proposed approach is able to predict whether overnight blood glucose concentrations are going to remain within or outside the target range, and therefore allows the user to take the appropriate preventive action (snack or change in basal insulin). For this purpose, a number of popular established machine learning algorithms for binary classification were evaluated and compared on a publicly available clinical dataset (i.e., OhioT1DM). Although there is no clearly superior classification algorithm, this study indicates that, by using commonly gathered data in type 1 diabetes management, it is possible to predict the quality of overnight glycaemic control with reasonable accuracy (AUC-ROC = 0.7).

Glycemic Outcomes in Adults With T1D Are Impacted More by Continuous Glucose Monitoring Than by Insulin Delivery Method: 3 Years of Follow-Up From the COMISAIR Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31530663/),"
This study assessed the clinical impact of four treatment strategies in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D): real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) with multiple daily insulin injections (rtCGM+MDI), rtCGM with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (rtCGM+CSII), self-monitoring of blood glucose with MDI (SMBG+MDI), and SMBG with CSII (SMBG+CSII).
This 3-year, nonrandomized, prospective, real-world, clinical trial followed 94 participants with T1D (rtCGM+MDI, n = 22; rtCGM+CSII, n = 26; SMBG+MDI, n = 21; SMBG+CSII, n = 25). The main end points were changes in A1C, time in range (70-180 mg/dL [3.9-10 mmol/L]), time below range (<70 mg/dL [<3.9 mmol/L]), glycemic variability, and incidence of hypoglycemia.
At 3 years, the rtCGM groups (rtCGM+MDI and rtCGM+CSII) had significantly lower A1C (7.0% [53 mmol/mol], P = 0.0002, and 6.9% [52 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001, respectively), compared with the SMBG+CSII and SMBG+MDI groups (7.7% [61 mmol/mol], P = 0.3574, and 8.0% [64 mmol/mol], P = 1.000, respectively), with no significant difference between the rtCGM groups. Significant improvements in percentage of time in range were observed in the rtCGM subgroups (rtCGM+MDI, 48.7-69.0%, P < 0.0001; and rtCGM+CSII, 50.9-72.3%, P < 0.0001) and in the SMBG+CSII group (50.6-57.8%, P = 0.0114). Significant reductions in time below range were found only in the rtCGM subgroups (rtCGM+MDI, 9.4-5.5%, P = 0.0387; and rtCGM+CSII, 9.0-5.3%, P = 0.0235). Seven severe hypoglycemia episodes occurred: SMBG groups, n = 5; sensor-augmented insulin regimen groups, n = 2.
rtCGM was superior to SMBG in reducing A1C, hypoglycemia, and other end points in individuals with T1D regardless of their insulin delivery method. rtCGM+MDI can be considered an equivalent but lower-cost alternative to sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and superior to treatment with SMBG+MDI or SMBG+CSII therapy.

Cost-effectiveness of the use of the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump versus daily multiple injections in type 1 diabetes adult patients at the Mexican Institute of Social Security.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31507338/),"
To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy versus multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) at the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS).
An analysis was developed using the internationally validated Core Diabetes Model (CDM) with which the incidence and progression of acute and chronic complications and the mortality of T1D was simulated throughout life. The baseline characteristics of the simulated cohorts were obtained from Mexican T1D adult patients aged ≥ 18 years that received care at two national IMSS medical centres in 2016. In the base case, the costs of the complications and treatment of the disease with both therapies were estimated in Mexican currency from the perspective of the institution, using Diagnosis Related Groups for outpatient and inpatient care. Utilities were taken from the international bibliography. In a secondary analysis, indirect costs were included using a human capital approach. The model used a lifetime time horizon, and a discount rate of 5% was applied for health outcomes and costs. A one-way sensitivity analysis was conducted on key variables and patient sub-groups; uncertainty was evaluated using a Cost-Effectiveness Acceptability Curve.
The average age of the cohort was 32 years, with diabetes duration of 19 years, an average HbA1c of 9.2%; 29% were men. A gain of 0.614 Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) was estimated with the use of CSII therapy. The estimated ICER was MXN$478,020 per QALY in the base case, and MXN$369,593 when indirect costs were considered. The sensitivity analysis showed that, in adult patients with HbA1c > 9.0%, the ICER was MXN$262,237.
This is the first economic evaluation study that compares CSII therapy versus MDI therapy for T1D adult patients in Mexico. The insulin pump therapy can be considered cost-effective in the context of the IMSS when considering a threshold of three GDPs per capita with 43.9% probability. Results improve substantially when patients have an HbA1c above 9%.

"Temporal Trends and Contemporary Use of Insulin Pump Therapy and Glucose Monitoring Among Children, Adolescents, and Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Between 1995 and 2017.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31488568/),"
To investigate temporal trends and contemporary use of insulin pump therapy and glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetes.
In a population-based study, we analyzed the use of insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) from 1995 to 2017 in patients with type 1 diabetes identified from the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up (DPV) database in Germany and Austria. Patients were stratified by age, sex, migration background, and country.
Among 96,547 patients with type 1 diabetes (median age 17.9 years, 53% males), the percentage using insulin pump therapy increased from 1% in 1995 to 53% in 2017, with the highest rates in the youngest patients (92% in preschoolers, 74% in children, 56% in adolescents aged <15 years, 46% in adolescents aged ≥15 years, 37% in adults). The percentage of patients using CGM increased from 3% in 2006 to 38% in 2017, with the highest rates in the youngest patients (58%, 52%, 45%, 33%, and 15% of respective age-groups). Daily SMBG frequencies increased from 1995 to 2016 and decreased afterward, most prominently in the youngest patients. Between 2015 and 2017, pump therapy was more frequently used in female versus male adolescents and adults (all P < 0.001), while no sex differences were observed for pump use in children <10 years (all P = 1.0) and for CGM use in all age-groups (all P = 1.0).
Since 1995, insulin pump use has continuously increased, and insulin pump therapy is now standard in patients aged <15 years. CGM use sharply rose in recent years, particularly in young children.

Efficacy of short-term intensive treatment with insulin pump to improve islet β-cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes via inhibition of oxidative stress.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31452715/),"
The present study (Chinese Trial Registry GTB7027) assessed the effects of short-term intensive treatment with insulin pump on islet cell function in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes and the possible mechanism. A total of 100 patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hospitalized between January 2016 and December 2017 were divided into a control and an experimental group (n=50 in each group). The subjects of the control group were administered multiple insulin injections for intensive treatment, while the experimental group received short-term intensive treatment with an insulin pump. Analysis of blood parameters, including lipids and glucose, as well as islet β-cell function were performed. The level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the patients was also measured. Oxidative stress indicators, including serum malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were also examined to explore the possible mechanism. The mRNA expression of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in PBMCs were analyzed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. The results indicated that the blood lipid levels were significantly improved in the two groups at two weeks, while the experimental group had significantly lower levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride, as well as low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The function of islet β-cells was significantly improved in the two groups. The insulin secretion index [homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of β-cell function] in the experimental group was higher, while the insulin resistance (IR) index (HOMA of IR) was significantly lower than that in the control group. The serum MDA level in the experimental group was significantly lower and the SOD level was significantly higher compared with that in the control group. Following treatment, the level of ROS in diabetic PBMCs was significantly reduced, and the transcription level of HO-1 and Nrf2 were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). These results demonstrated that short-term intensive treatment with an insulin pump significantly improved lipid and blood glucose metabolism to protect islet function as well as significantly reducing the level of oxidative stress in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.

Perceived Benefits and Barriers Regarding CSII Treatment: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Insulin Pump Attitudes Questionnaire (IPA-Questionnaire).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31426110/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is the most advanced and demanding form of insulin therapy. Various positive and negative expectations, attitudes and experiences can occur, influencing adherence to and efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. A new questionnaire was developed to systematically assess perceived benefits, perceived barriers and handling of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy.
The Insulin Pump Attitude Questionnaire was tested in two samples (n=265/452) comprising pump users and non-pump users. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha estimation. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to establish the factorial structure. Correlations with other questionnaires as well as group differences between pump users and non-pump users were used to assess validity.
Exploratory factor analysis revealed 26 items comprising six subscales: ""Glycaemic Control"", ""Flexibility"", ""Impaired Body Image"", ""Technology Dependency"", ""Ease Of Use"" and ""Functionality"". Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed this factor structure. The IPA sum score correlated significantly with diabetes distress (r=-0.30), self-efficacy (r=0.22), diabetes empowerment (r=0.36), psychological well-being (r=0.16) and treatment dissatisfaction (r=-0.24), supporting criterion validity with small to medium effect sizes. Furthermore, the IPA was able to differentiate between pump users and non-pump users with higher scores for pump users regarding ""Glycaemic Control"", ""Flexibility"", ""Ease of use"" and ""Functionality"" and lower scores for pump users regarding ""Impaired Body Image"" and ""Technology Dependency"".
The Insulin Pump Attitude Questionnaire is a reliable and valid new instrument to assess attitudes towards continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. With six scales, the Insulin Pump Attitude Questionnaire provides a comprehensive analysis of possible benefits, barriers, and handling problems of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. In clinical practice, the Insulin Pump Attitude Questionnaire might be used to address the different attitudes in pump users but also in people considering continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy.

No Disadvantage to Insulin Pump Off vs Pump On During Intermittent High-Intensity Exercise in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31416695/),"
Evidence suggests that patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) performing aerobic exercise with their insulin pump connected (pump on) vs pump disconnected (pump off) have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. It has not been examined whether this risk remains during high-intensity exercise. This study compared the effects of pump on (50% basal insulin at exercise onset) vs pump off (0% basal insulin at exercise onset) on glucose concentrations during intermittent high-intensity exercise in adults with T1D and on patients' own perspective of their glycemia.
Twelve adults with T1D using insulin pump therapy completed two 40-min intermittent high-intensity exercise bouts. Insulin adjustments included: 1) pump set to 50% of usual basal rate (pump on) or 2) pump suspended (pump off) during exercise, in random order. Blood glucose was recorded every 10 min during exercise and, after providing subjects with an initial reference glucose value before exercise, participants were asked to estimate their glucose during exercise.
Glucose levels were higher in pump off (8.1±1.3 mmol/L) vs pump on (7.4±2.1 mmol/L) at exercise start (p<0.05), but were similar by the end of exercise (p=0.9). During exercise, hypoglycemia incidence did not differ between conditions (1 of 12 for both). However, the percentage of time in hypoglycemia at 12 h after exercise was 5±8% vs 1±2% for pump on vs pump off, respectively (p=0.3). Participants were better able to estimate their own glucose during pump on vs pump off (r2=0.46 vs r2=0.11).
Pump on vs pump off at exercise onset showed no significant differences in blood glucose concentrations during 40 min of intermittent high-intensity exercise.

Long-term body weight trajectories and metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients on insulin pump or multiple daily injections: A 10-year retrospective controlled study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31371264/),"
Overweight/obesity is a clinical concern also in patients with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM). These patients' body weight may vary depending on whether treatment consists in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI), as these treatments lead to different blood glucose control, insulin doses, and eating behaviors. We compared long-term body weight trajectories in persons with diabetes on CSII or MDI regimens.
Annual changes in body weight, HbA1c, and daily insulin doses over 6-10 years were retrospectively analyzed in T1DM adult patients on CSII (n = 90) or MDI (n = 90), strictly matched for sex, age, BMI, and diabetes duration. Mean follow-up was 9.1 ± 1.4 years. Body weight increased linearly (∼0.5 kg per year) throughout the observation period (p = 0.001, repeated measures ANOVA) with no significant difference between the CSII and MDI cohorts (p = 0.74), in either normal-weight or overweight/obese patients. HbA1c over follow-up was lower with CSII than with MDI (p = 0.037), maintaining the initial reduction after starting pump therapy. Insulin doses over follow-up were stably lower than baseline (∼20%) with CSII, while linearly increasing (∼20% from baseline to the end of observation) with MDI (p = 0.002). Mean annual weight changes correlated directly with total insulin dose changes (r = 0.191; p = 0.011) and baseline HbA1c level (r = 0.267; p = 0.001), and inversely with HbA1c changes (-0.173; p = 0.021) and baseline age (r = -0.254; p = 0.001).
T1DM patients on CSII or MDI showed comparable body weight gain over a 10-year follow-up, despite improved glycemic control and decreased insulin doses with CSII.

Satisfaction with the Use of Different Technologies for Insulin Delivery and Glucose Monitoring Among Adults with Long-Standing Type 1 Diabetes and Problematic Hypoglycemia: 2-Year Follow-Up in the HypoCOMPaSS Randomized Clinical Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31335201/),"

Background:
 In the HypoCOMPaSS trial, adults with long-standing type 1 diabetes and problematic hypoglycemia were randomized to compare insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; CSII) with multiple daily injections (MDI) and real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) with conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG). Our aim was to investigate participants' satisfaction with these technologies at 6-month randomized, controlled trial (RCT) endpoint and at 2-year follow-up. 
Methods:
 Participants completed the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire subscales ""device delivery"" and ""hypoglycemia control""; and Glucose Monitoring Experience Questionnaire, assessing ""convenience"", ""effectiveness"", ""intrusiveness"", and ""total satisfaction."" We assessed change over time and between-group differences by insulin and monitoring modalities. 
Results:
 Participants (N = 96) were 64% women, aged 49 ± 12 years, with a diabetes duration of 29 ± 12 years. At 6 months, participants reported improvements compared with baseline (all P < 0.001) in satisfaction with insulin ""delivery device"" (r = 0.39) and ""hypoglycemia control"" (r = 0.52), and trends toward significance in perceived ""effectiveness"" (r = 0.42) and ""intrusiveness"" (r = 0.27) of monitoring device (but not ""convenience"", P = 0.139). All improvements were sustained at 2 years. At 6 months, the only difference between arms was that greater satisfaction with insulin ""delivery device"" was reported in the CSII group compared with MDI (P < 0.001, r = 0.40). No between-group differences were observed at 2 years. 
Conclusions:
 Overall, significant improvements in participant satisfaction with diabetes technologies were observed over the 6-month RCT, in all domains except ""convenience,"" and maintained at 2 years. Although HypoCOMPaSS demonstrated noninferiority of SMBG versus CGM, and MDI versus CSII in terms of biomedical outcomes, detailed assessments confirm that participants' satisfaction with delivery device was greater in those allocated to CSII than MDI.

Adherence to insulin pump treatment declines with increasing age in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31292993/),"
This study assessed the impact of illness perceptions, emotional responses to the disease and its management, and patient characteristics on the adherence to optimal insulin pump management in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
From May to December 2013 and May 2015 to September 2016, we investigated 90 adolescents (50% boys), 12-18 years with type 1 diabetes. We analysed the association of optimal adherence to insulin pump therapy to age, gender, diabetes duration, results of questionnaires relating to fear and problems of self-testing, illness perceptions, emotional distress and family conflicts. Optimal adherence was defined as bolusing insulin on average ≥2.5/3 main meals/d.
Adolescents with suboptimal adherence were on average 1.8 years older (95% Confidence Interval 1.09-2.50 years, P < .001) than those with optimal adherence. After adjustment for age, no other patient or parent factors were related to optimal adherence.
Adherence to insulin pump self-management in adolescents with type 1 diabetes declined with increasing age, illustrating the challenges of transition of self-management from parents to the adolescent patient themselves.

Evaluating the impact of an insulin pump discontinuation action plan on patient or caregiver confidence and anxiety.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31275878/),"
Insulin pump failure and adverse events are common and therefore anticipatory education is recommended. Research in other chronic diseases shows written action plans improve confidence and adherence during an acute deterioration. However, no similar data exists for patients with type one diabetes mellitus provided with anticipatory education via an insulin pump action plan. This study evaluates whether an insulin pump action plan improves patient and caregiver confidence in managing a potential pump failure without a subsequent increase in anxiety.
Adults with type one diabetes mellitus and caregivers of children with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions across four New Zealand diabetes services participated. Participants completed a questionnaire examining pump-related adverse events and self-reported confidence and anxiety in managing pump failure. An insulin pump action plan and focused education by their diabetes team was provided, with a follow-up questionnaire at least 3 months later.
174/270 pump patients participated initially, with a follow-up response rate of 84.5% (147/174). Despite prior provision, many could not recall having an insulin pump action plan at study commencement (101/174, 58%), and of these 92% stated they would have liked one. Patients had good levels of confidence in the reliability of their pump and infusion sets/sites (Likert scores of 4.4/5 and 3.95/5) which was not undermined by the insulin pump action plan. Confidence in managing a potential pump failure showed a small but significant increase (3.66/5 to 3.95/5, p = 0.004) present in both adults and parents, with anxiety also showing a small increase (2.16/5 to 2.38/5, p = 0.012).
Patient recall of prior insulin pump action plan education is poor, with the vast majority of patients interested in further written anticipatory education regarding potential pump failure. The provision of an insulin pump action plan increases self-reported confidence in managing unexpected pump failure with a small associated increase in anxiety.

Insulin pump initiation and education for children and adolescents - a qualitative study of current practice in New Zealand.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31275875/),"
Worldwide, the use of insulin pumps for the management of type 1 diabetes is increasing. There are no national or international published guidelines and few guidance recommendations detailing the education and training required to commence insulin pump therapy. The aim of this study is to describe current clinical practice regarding initiation of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in New Zealand.
Pediatric diabetes nurse specialists from selected New Zealand hospitals (n = 16) were identified and invited to participate in this qualitative study. For those consenting, structured interviews were conducted. The questions covered basic hospital demographics and various aspects of insulin pump initiation including pump start planning, education, and aspects of follow-up and after-care.
The response rate was 100% (16 out of 16 hospitals). Diabetes clinics interviewed varied in size from 50 to 450 pediatric patients and frequency of insulin pump use from 11% - 46%. Clinical practice differed between clinics. Important differences related to: use of continuous glucose monitoring (12/16); and differing views on immediate vs. delayed use of pump advanced features. Location of pump starts also varied, with both in-patient (2/16) and out-patient (14/16) approaches seen. The motivations and beliefs relating to these various pump start approaches also varied.
Differences seen between hospitals reflected team preference, and possibly a lack of consensus/guidance from the medical literature. Lessons may be learnt and further rationalisation and improvement in education remains possible by combining and adopting strengths from different hospitals.

Coping strategies in people with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump treatment.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31240899/),"
In stressed people with diabetes (PWD) glycemia varies idiosyncratically. Coping is a relatively stable personality trait that assesses how individual deals with stress. Insulin pumps are considered the best insulin delivery system but require more attention from PWD, virtually increasing stress levels. Aim of our study was to evaluate the coping strategies adopted by a pool of participants with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy.
We collected data from 158 people with T1DM on CSII. COPE-NVI Test was administered and we also collected: hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 30 days of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) records (the most recent). From SMBG and CGM records we computed Kovatchev indexes. We investigated bivariate correlations between HbA1c, indexes and the results of the COPE-NVI Test; the analysis was performed on the total sample and on two sub-groups: men and women. The participants were then divided into clusters and non-parametric tests were performed.
Regarding bivariate correlation, at a level of significance of 95%, several statistically significant correlations were found in the total sample and in both men and women sub-groups. Regarding non-parametric tests, we observed statistically significant results in clusters of the total sample and clusters of the sub-group formed by men, divided according to Low Blood Glucose Index (LBGI) risk, showing a different use of certain coping strategies.
Assessing coping strategies preferably used by PWD is useful to select PWD in need of counseling and empowerment-oriented training in order to improve glycemic outcomes and decrease severe hypo/hyperglycemic events.

Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in Adult Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients: Results from a Public Health System.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31199682/),"

Aims:
 To analyze prevalence and clinical effect of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in adult type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients in a public health system real-world scenario. 
Materials and Methods:
 All adult T1DM patients on CSII being followed at Castilla-La Mancha Health Public Service were included. Primary efficacy outcome was the change in HbA1c during the follow-up. Secondary efficacy outcomes included evaluation of the following variables: insulin pump indications, diabetes complication rates, insulin and pump use, continuous glucose monitoring use, patients achieving an HbA1c decrease ≥6 mmol/mol (0.5%) with or without severe hypoglycemia, and discontinuations. Direct patient data were typed through the web-based Spanish national registry on CSII therapy by nine diabetologists from eight different health care areas. 
Results:
 A total of 7% of T1DM adult patients were treated with insulin pumps in our region, with a regional prevalence of 18.7 CSII patients/100,000 inhabitants. Three hundred thirteen patients were analyzed with a mean age of 34.1 ± 11.0 years and T1DM duration of 16.6 ± 9.7 years. Mean duration of CSII therapy was 6.2 ± 4.0 years. Data completion was 91.2%. Main indications for treatment were high glucose variability (36%) and suboptimal glycemic control (32%). Mean duration of CSII therapy was 6.2 ± 4.0 years. Sensor-augment pump therapy was used by 26% of the patients. Glycated hemoglobin decreased to -5 mmol/mol (95% CI -6 to -3 mmol/mol; P < 0.001) during the follow-up (Mean difference in change -0.4%, 95% CI -0.5 to -0.2; P < 0.001). Percentage of patients with severe hypoglycemia decreased from 32% to 13% (P < 0.001). Frequent nonsevere hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis were less frequent among patients using higher number of daily basal rates at the study end. The rate of CSII interruption was 3.8%. 
Conclusions:
 Prevalence of CSII therapy in our region remains under 10% of adult T1DM patients, although CSII treatment was associated with a sustained improvement in glycemic control.

New Design of a Percutaneous Port System for Continuous Intraperitoneal Insulin Infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31195815/),"
Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is treated with intensive insulin therapy using multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with insulin pumps. For people with diabetes who cannot achieve acceptable glycemic control despite the use of intensive insulin therapy and continuous glucose measurement, there exists the possibility of continuous intraperitoneal insulin delivery via an implantable pump or a percutaneous port system that is connected to an external insulin pump. In this article, the current second generation of the Accu-ChekÂ® DiaPort system for continuous intraperitoneal insulin delivery with its improvements over the former generation is presented and discussed.

Using insulin pump with a remote-control system in young patients with diabetes improves glycemic control and enhances patient satisfaction.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31183161/),"
Insulin delivery triggered by a remote control is an advanced feature offered by newer insulin pump systems. These remote-integrated pump systems might further improve glycemic control and patient satisfaction. This study aims at assessing the effects of advanced insulin pump system on patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
The prospective, observational study in two centers addressed patients on multiple daily injection (MDI) switching to an integrated pump system (primary: adolescents and young adults, secondary: school-children). Treatment and patient satisfaction parameters were recorded at baseline and at two visits at 12 and 24 weeks.
Thirty-eight patients were analyzed; primary n = 24 (mean-age 16) and secondary n = 14 (mean-age 9). From baseline to visit2, the mean decrease of HbA1c was 1.09% (p = 0.00009) and 0.79% (p = 0.09) for the primary and secondary group, respectively. Patient satisfaction rate was favorable. Exploratory analyses revealed patients favoring the use of the remote control achieved best reductions in HbA1c (p = 0.0174). Safety was encouraging with no adverse events in the period from visit1 to visit2.
Switching young T1DM patients from MDI to a remote control-integrated pump system achieved a reductions in HbA1c and insulin dose. Positive attitude towards remote operating enhanced these effects. Patient satisfaction has markedly improved.

Long-Term Effectiveness of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in the Prevention of Hypoglycemia in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31180239/),"

Background:
 Reducing hyperglycemia while avoiding hypoglycemia is the key clinical goal in managing people with type 1 diabetes. Insulin delivery techniques and regimens are constantly evolving to achieve these goals. At present, use of multiple daily injections (MDI) is the standard of care, but there is increasing interest in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). There is a deficit of studies comparing long-term glycemic control and hypoglycemia outcomes between these therapeutic options. 
Methods:
 This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of adults with type 1 diabetes. Data were derived from electronic medical records and included demographic and clinical factors. Participants had all undergone intensive diabetes education, followed by CSII or continued MDI. The primary outcome was difference in hypoglycemia, defined as the percentage of self-monitoring blood glucose levels less than 3.9 mmol/L. Up to 10 years of follow-up data were available, between 2000 and 2016. 
Results:
 There were 69 participants using CSII and 78 using MDI. Self-monitoring blood glucose data showed significantly less hypoglycemia with CSII by over 30%, occurring as early as the first year and sustained throughout the follow-up period (P < 0.001). This benefit of CSII on reducing hypoglycemia was independent of more frequent hypoglycemia and higher body weight at baseline, factors that were also independently associated with reduced hypoglycemia. 
Conclusions:
 In selected adults with type 1 diabetes, long-term CSII can provide long-term clinically relevant and sustained reductions in hypoglycemia, particularly in those with greater initial risk of hypoglycemia and higher body weight, and improved glycemic control compared with MDI.

Early Initiation of Diabetes Devices Relates to Improved Glycemic Control in Children with Recent-Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31166808/),"

Objective:
 To test whether the addition of an insulin pump or continuous glucose monitor (CGM) related to reduced glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in large cohort of children, 5-9 years old, and within 1 year of their type 1 diabetes (T1D) diagnosis. 
Research Design and Methods:
 The study uses data from families of children with recent-onset T1D and who were between 5 and 9 years old. Study analyses used children's HbA1c values at baseline and at the 6-month follow-up. Parents reported on family demographics and children's T1D device use in their daily management (e.g., insulin pump or CGM). Children's mean T1D duration was 4.70 ± 3.28 months at baseline, so the 6-month assessment point was ∼12 months postdiagnosis. 
Results:
 One hundred-eleven families participated. At baseline, child mean age was 7.51 ± 1.37 years, and mean child HbA1c was 7.65% ± 1.40%. In addition, 17% of children used an insulin pump, and 17.1% of children used CGM. Six months later, 35.1% of children had started an insulin pump and 25.2% had started CGM. Repeated measures analyses of variance results showed a smaller overall HbA1c between baseline and 6 months for children using an insulin pump versus children not on a pump. For CGM, results showed that children starting a CGM during this window had a significantly lower HbA1c level than children who had not started on CGM. 
Conclusions:
 The study results suggest that early initiation of either an insulin pump or CGM in children newly diagnosed with T1D may help to improve child HbA1c levels within the first 12 months of diabetes.

Comparative Dose Accuracy of Durable and Patch Insulin Pumps Under Laboratory Conditions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31149838/),"

Background:
 Recent studies demonstrate variable results of the accuracy with which patch pumps infuse insulin. Aim of this evaluation was to measure dose accuracies of the patch pump mylife™ OmniPod® (OP) in comparison with the durable insulin pump MiniMed® 640G (MM) simulating real-life clinical situations under laboratory conditions. 
Methods:
 Thirty-two OP and 15 MM were tested using insulin aspart at five different boluses (0.5, 1, 5, 10, and 15 international units [IU]) and three basal rates (0.2, 0.6, and 1.8 IU/h) at different time points during a 70 h investigation period. Owing to malfunctions only 22 OP and 11 MM could be analyzed. Dose accuracy was measured by an experimental setting based on IEC 60601-2-24:2012 with determination of weight differences of insulin collection tubes before and after experiments using a precision scale. A maximal tolerance of ±5% for boluses and basal rates was considered adequate according to IEC 60601-2-24:2012. 
Results:
 For the five boluses, the percentages of measurement results within the ±5% accuracy threshold were as follows: OP (18.6%, 26.5%, 89.0%, 96.0%, and 96.0%); MM (21.7%, 44.1%, 88.1%, 98.3%, and 100.0%). Both pumps were more accurate at higher bolus volumes (5, 10, and 15 IU), later bolus periods, and if the accuracy threshold was lowered to <10%, <15%, or >15%. For the three basal rates, the percentages within the ±5% accuracy threshold were as follows: OP (66.7%, 22.7%, and 16.7%); MM (14.3%, 0.0%, and 0.0%). 
Conclusion:
 This study demonstrates low accuracy for basal rates and single bolus deliveries at low insulin doses for both pump models. Clinicians should be aware of this variability when initiating insulin pump therapy especially in insulin-sensitive patients with low insulin dose requirements.

Effects of Diabetes Numeracy on Glycemic Control and Diabetes Self-Management Behaviors in Patients on Insulin Pump Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148053/),"
Diabetes numeracy (DN) skills are crucial in patients on insulin pump therapy. Little evidence exists regarding DN in this patient population.
This exploratory, observational, cross-sectional study assessed the DN levels of patients on insulin pump therapy and potential relationships with glycemic control and self-management behaviors. Seventy-two patients on insulin pump therapy were recruited from one specialty endocrinology clinic. Subjects completed validated tools to measure DN [Diabetes Numeracy Test (DNT-15)] and self-management behaviors [Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire (DSMQ)]. A general diabetes questionnaire assessed socioeconomic information and self-efficacy. Additional self-management behaviors and glycemic control data were collected from patients' medical records. Patients were categorized into two groups based on DNT-15 scores to explore potential relationships between DN scores and patient characteristics, glycemic control, and self-management behaviors.
Average age was 52 ± 15 years, glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) was 7.7% ± 1.2% (61 mmol/mol), duration of diabetes was 28 ± 15 years, and duration of pump use was 3.4 ± 1.3 years. The average DNT-15 score was 87.5% ± 18%. Forty-three participants (60%) scored ≥ 90% and 29 participants (40%) scored < 90%. Eighteen percent were unable to calculate the carbohydrate content from a nutrition label. Participants with lower DNT-15 scores had higher A1C levels (8.0% vs. 7.5%, p = 0.04), were older (58.3 vs. 47.7, p = 0.003), were more likely to describe their diabetes self-care as poor (p = 0.04), and were less confident in using their pump features (p = 0.02) than those with higher DNT-15 scores.
Many patients on insulin pump therapy have deficiencies with DN which may be associated with older age and higher A1C levels.

A Review of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Data Interpretation in the Age of Automated Insulin Delivery.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31130007/),"
Using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) improves glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes. The ambulatory glucose profile (AGP) has been recommended as a standard method for reporting CGM data. However, in recently developed automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, a standard format for reporting data has not yet been developed. Instead, reports are specific to each system being used. Currently, the only FDA approved AID system is a hybrid closed-loop insulin pump. In these systems, the patient is still required to announce a meal, respond to alerts, and keep the system in automated insulin delivery. The integrated pump and sensor information provides insights into how the system is performing, and how to make changes to tunable parameters, such as carbohydrate to insulin ratios. The reports also offer a window into human behavior related to performing diabetes tasks, responding to alarms, reasons for exiting HCL, and how glycemic goals are being met. This article reviews the pump and CGM data provided by several of the current closed-loop systems with a focus on systems that are currently approved in the United States (MiniMedâ„¢ 670G, Tandem Basal:IQ) and those used by patients using do-it-yourself systems. A step-wise approach to reviewing the nuances of these systems is provided. The comparison may reinforce the importance of the continued need for streamlining a standard report for providers to be able to interpret the CGM data of these systems.

Comparison of flash glucose monitoring with real time continuous glucose monitoring in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31121275/),"
In 2016 intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) became the first reimbursed CGM system in Belgium. Many children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) treated with multiple daily injections as well as with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) switched from self-monitoring of blood glucose to isCGM to monitor their treatment. In 2017 the Enlite® real-time CGM (rtCGM) system was reimbursed enabling its use with the Minimed® 640G insulin pump with integrated SmartGuard technology. In this study we compared the metabolic control during CSII with isCGM with that during rtCGM. Patient's satisfaction and side effects of the rtCGM system were also evaluated.
20 children with T1D, aged 5-16 years, were included. Metabolic control during the last month of isCGM use was compared to that during the 3rd and 6th month of rtCGM.
Three patients stopped early rtCGM mainly due to calibration burden. The HbA1c level and the mean glucose value in the other patients did not change after switching to the rtCGM system. Glucose variability was smaller (46.2% vs 38.4% and 36.4%, p = 0.000). Time in hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl) was lower (7.4% vs 1.6% and 1.5%, p = 0.000). The main patient inconvenience was the sensor calibration.
Our data show that during Enlite® rtCGM with the Minimed® 640G pump system glucose variability was smaller and the patients spent less time in hypoglycemia than during isCGM. The need for timely calibrations is considered as the main drawback of the system.

Patient Perception and Satisfaction With Insulin Pump System: Pilot User Experience Survey.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055947/),"
The goal of this study was to assess patient perspectives and satisfaction with the MiniMed 670G insulin pump. Those participants who used the pump as part of a hybrid closed loop were also asked to provide their views on the automatic feature (auto mode).
Adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus using the Medtronicâ„¢ 670G pump were asked about their experience with the device using a semi-structured survey developed by the research team. Responses were quantified to identify emergent themes.
Seventeen participants used the pump as part of a hybrid closed loop system, while four participants used the pump in combination with a nonintegrated continuous glucose monitoring system. Overall, participants indicated a high level of satisfaction with the pump (14/21) mostly because of improvements in blood glucose (BG) control (15/21). Least liked features were physical design and structure (6/21), frequency of user input (5/21), alert frequency (4/21), and difficulty of use (3/21). Those using the hybrid closed loop were satisfied with the auto mode feature (11/17), mostly because of improvements in BG control (9/17). The least liked features of the auto mode technology were that blood glucose levels remained elevated (5/17) and the frequency of alerts (4/17).

To examine the distribution and association of sociodemographic, adherence, and barriers-to-care factors in relation to glycaemic control within insulin regimens in US children with Type 1 diabetes in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study.
Self- or parent-reported data from 1095 children with Type 1 diabetes aged 10-17 years were collected on insulin regimen, sociodemographics, diabetes self-management, diabetes-related family conflict and barriers to care. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified poor glycaemic control correlates within each insulin regimen.
Participants included 694 children on insulin pump therapy, 188 receiving basal-bolus injections, and 213 on a mixed insulin regimen. Of these, 28.5%, 45.2% and 51.2%, respectively, had poor glycaemic control [HbA1c ≥ 80 mmol/mol (9.5%)]. Family conflict between parent and child regarding diabetes management was the only factor significantly associated with poor glycaemic control in all insulin regimens (insulin pump, P≤ 0.0001; basal-bolus injections, P=0.0002; mixed insulin regimen, P=0.0103). For children on insulin pump, poor control was significantly associated with non-white race (P=0.0008), living in multiple households (P=0.0331), having Medicaid insurance (P=0.0090), and decreased insulin adherence (P<0.0001). For children on a mixed insulin regimen, living in multiple households (P=0.0256) and not spending enough time with healthcare provider (P=0.0058) correlated with poor control.
A high percentage of US children with Type 1 diabetes had poor glycaemic control, especially those not using an insulin pump. Early identification of children with risk factors associated with poor glycaemic control within insulin regimens and addressing diabetes-related family conflict may allow interventions to improve diabetes management.

Efficacy and safety of suspend-before-low insulin pump technology in hypoglycaemia-prone adults with type 1 diabetes (SMILE): an open-label randomised controlled trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31047902/),"
Hypoglycaemia unawareness and severe hypoglycaemia can increase fear of hypoglycaemia and the risk of subsequent hypoglycaemic events. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of insulin pump therapy with integrated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and a suspend-before-low feature (Medtronic MiniMed 640G with SmartGuard) in hypoglycaemia-prone adults with type 1 diabetes.
SMILE was an open-label randomised controlled trial done in people aged 24-75 years with type 1 diabetes for 10 years or longer, HbA1c values of 5·8-10·0% (40-86 mmol/mol), and at high risk of hypoglycaemia (recent severe hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemia unawareness defined by a Clarke or Gold score ≥4). Participants were enrolled from 16 centres (eg, clinics, hospitals, or university medical centres) in Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. After baseline run-in phase (2 weeks), participants were randomly assigned to the MiniMed 640G pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) with self-monitoring of blood glucose (control group) or to the MiniMed 640G system with the suspend-before-low feature enabled (intervention group), for 6 months. The study statistician analysing the data was masked to group assignment until final database lock; because of the nature of the intervention, participants and treating clinicians could not be masked to group assignment. The primary outcome was the mean number of sensor hypoglycaemic events, defined as 55 mg/dL (3·1 mmol/L) or lower, and was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis in all randomly assigned participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02733991, and is completed.
Between Dec 7, 2016, and March 27, 2018, 153 participants with a mean age 48·2 [12·4] years were randomly assigned: 77 to the control group (mean age 47·4 [12·5] years) and 76 to the intervention group (mean age 49·0 [12·2] years). After 6 months, the intervention group had significantly fewer hypoglycaemic events per participant per week (1·1 [SD 1·2] vs 4·1 [3·4] mean events, model-based treatment effect -2·9 [95% CI -3·5 to -2·3]; p<0·0001) and fewer severe hypoglycaemic events (instances requiring third-party assistance with carbohydrate or glucagon administration, or other resuscitative actions) overall (three vs 18; p=0·0036). The most common adverse events were hypoglycaemia (observed in ten [13%] of 77 participants in the control group vs four [5%] of 76 in the intervention group) and hyperglycaemia (observed in seven [9%] of 77 vs seven [9%] of 76). No serious adverse device effects or episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis were reported.
Insulin pump therapy with integrated CGM and a suspend-before-low feature reduced the frequency of sensor hypoglycaemic and severe hypoglycaemic events in hypoglycaemia-prone adults compared with use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion without real-time CGM. These results suggest that this technology could be beneficial in this high-risk population.

Brittle diabetes revisited: a description of erratic and difficult-to-control diabetes in an elderly woman with Type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31004371/),"
'Brittle diabetes' is frequently attributed to psychological stressors causing insulin omission in young women with Type 1 diabetes. It has received little attention in the recent medical literature.
We report the case of an 87-year-old woman who had recurrent episodes of unexplained diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite frequent inpatient monitoring of capillary glucose, her blood glucose levels remained erratic. She experienced a total of 12 episodes of ketoacidosis (some occurring during hospitalization), with 11 episodes occurring over a 3-month period. Several episodes of ketoacidosis required care in a high-dependency unit and up to 32 h of intravenous insulin and fluids. Extensive investigations failed to identify any underlying cause of the recurrent ketoacidosis. Ultimately, the introduction of a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump resulted in improved glycaemic control and avoided the need for further hospitalizations.
Individuals of advanced age can benefit from insulin pump therapy. The original definition of 'brittle diabetes' referred to patients whose lives were 'constantly disrupted by episodes of hypo- or hyperglycaemia'. Our case reminds us that this clinical entity can result from altered biology and is not always related to psychological stressors.

The Predictive Low Glucose Management System in Prevention of Clinically Significant Hypoglycemia in Type 1 Diabetes. A Preliminary Study Identifying the Most Common Events Leading Up to Hypoglycemia During Insulin Pump Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30986882/),"
Prevention of hypoglycemia remains a major challenge in diabetic management, despite the introduction of modern insulin pumps in daily clinical practice. The Low Glucose Suspend (LGS) and the newer Predictive Low Glucose Management (PLGM) systems incorporated in the Medtronic insulin pumps have shown promising results in prevention of hypoglycemia. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the 2 systems relative to the frequency of clinically significant hypoglycemia in Type 1 diabetes (T1DM). In addition, we investigated the events preceding clinically significant hypoglycemia episodes.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 T1DM patients using the MiniMed 640G vs. 30 using the MiniMed Veo sensor-augmented insulin pump. All data was recorded during patients' normal daily activity and living conditions. The patients were matched for age and duration of diabetes.
PLGM use was associated with lower incidence of clinically significant hypoglycemia (1.9±1.4 vs. 3.6±1.9 episodes per week), along with reduced exposure to hypoglycemia. The data indicated that both pump systems are effective in preventing severe hypoglycemic episodes. In both groups the most common events preceding hypoglycemic episodes included adjustment of hyperglycemia, basal rate increase and miscalculation of carbohydrates.
The results indicated that the use of the Minimed 640G pump system can help reduce the frequency of clinically significant hypoglycemia. Management of hyperglycemia must be addressed in diabetes education programs in order to encourage proper adjustment of high blood glucose levels. Future studies would be useful in exploring the details of the events preceding hypoglycemia episodes in insulin pump users.

Glycated Hemoglobin Differences Among Blog-Reading Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Compared With Those Who Do Not Read Blogs: Cross-Sectional Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30938693/),"
Of the estimated 23.1 million individuals diagnosed with diabetes, approximately 5% have type 1 diabetes (T1D). It has been proposed that this number will triple by 2050. With increases in technology use and resources available, many individuals are using insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) to help manage their T1D. They are also using online resources such as social media to find more information and advice based on real-life experiences from peers. Blogs are a particular social media modality often used by people with T1D but have not been widely investigated.
The purpose of this study was to assess glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) differences between blog readers and blog nonusers in a population of adults with T1D. This study also looked at differences in technology use in these two groups, as well as HbA1c differences in blog use and technology subgroups.
Participants were recruited both by mail and by online T1D-themed blog postings. Respondents completed a secure online eligibility assessment and were asked questions related to their T1D, blog and internet use, and insulin pump and CGM use. Demographics were also collected. Differences between blog readers and blog nonusers were tested via chi-square and t tests. Mann-Whitney U tests, Fisher exact tests, and analyses of variance (ANOVA) were used to test for differences in self-reported HbA1c between groups and subgroups.
A total of 282 eligible participants completed the survey (214 blog readers, 68 blog nonusers). Average duration of diabetes was 21.2 years, 77.7% (219/282) were female, 81.2% (229/282) used an insulin pump, 66.3% (187/282) used a CGM, and 95.7% (270/282) were white. HbA1c was lower for blog readers (7.0%) than blog nonusers (7.5%), P=.006; for insulin pump users (7.0%) than multiple daily injections (7.7%), P=.001; and for CGM users (7.0%) than CGM nonusers (7.5%), P=.001. After adjusting for significant covariates, the association between blog use and HbA1c remained significant (P=.04). ANOVA modeling also demonstrated significant differences in HbA1c between blog users and nonusers among subgroups by pump use and CGM use (P<.001).
These results suggest that reading blogs is associated with lower HbA1c values. While association does not prove causation, blog readers have the benefit of learning information from peers and having 24/7 access to a community of individuals with similar daily life struggles, where they are able to ask questions and seek advice.

Impact of Medicare Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Policies in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30931609/),"
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has numerous requirements for coverage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; insulin pump). Due to recent improvements in diabetes treatment, people with type 1 diabetes are living longer, resulting in an increase in the number of individuals who are eligible for Medicare and are impacted by CMS policies regarding CSII.
Two hundred forty-one adults with type 1 diabetes who had been on CSII with CMS coverage for at least 6 months were surveyed. Median age was 67 years, mean A1c was 7.0%, 64% were women, 93% were white, and the median type 1 diabetes duration was 42 years. Participants reported median CSII use of 15 years and 82% were on CSII before starting CMS.
Of those starting CSII while on CMS, challenges included cost of supplies (29%) or the insulin pump (24%). The majority (57.5%) reported issues with obtaining supplies, the most common problems being delays in release of supplies (29%), difficulty getting paperwork completed (23.5%), and seeing a health care provider every 90 days (18%). Participants reported changing their CSII behaviors because of supply delays (39%) including leaving site in place >3 days (64%), and reusing pump supplies (34%). Consequently, participants reported adverse outcomes including more erratic (48%) or higher (42%) blood glucose and pain or irritation at sites (34%).
This study concluded that current CMS CSII policies promote adverse CSII behaviors and outcomes in type 1 diabetes and thus call for changes in the CMS CSII policies.

Tissue Response to Subcutaneous Infusion Catheter.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30931603/),"
Insulin infusion pump, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and insulin infusion set (IIS) have been developed to be increasingly feasible for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Several recently approved CGMs are transitioning from 7-day to 10-day wear time without the need for fingerprick recalibration. Nevertheless, studies and improvements on IIS, a critical part of insulin pump therapy, have been limited. In particular, the recommended wear time of IIS is still 2-3â€‰days, which can hardly match the current duration of CGM for potential closed-loop system development. It is generally believed that both the inserted catheter and the subsequent infused insulin drug could induce particular subcutaneous tissue response and skin-related complications at the infusion site. In certain cases, poor glycaemic control, increased risk of hypoglycemia, and serious cosmetic impact on people with diabetes were observed. Skin complication has also been attributed as an important factor resulting users to discontinue insulin pump therapy. This article provides the rare systematic review of IIS induced subcutaneous tissue responses and skin complications, including the impacts from the inserted catheters, the subcutaneous infused insulin, and the adhesive or tape used to immobilize the catheter. The FDA's recommendation for the frequency of IIS change was further discussed. Future studies on this topic are required to further understand the IIS-related problems, and future strategies could be developed accordingly to significantly reduce the incidence of these problems, extend the wear time, and increase the acceptance of insulin pump based therapy.

Accuracy of Bolus and Basal Rate Delivery of Different Insulin Pump Systems.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30901232/),"
Insulin pumps are used for basal rate and bolus insulin delivery in patients with diabetes. In this in vitro study, accuracy of delivery of different commercial insulin pumps was evaluated.
Accuracy of 10 different insulin pump systems (5 durable pumps with different insulin infusion sets and 1 patch pump) was tested with a microgravimetric method. Mean bolus accuracy of 25 successive 1 U boluses and of 12 successive 10 U boluses was assessed, and delivery time for 10 U boluses was measured. Basal rate accuracy at 1.0 U/h was evaluated for 72 h and for individual 1-h windows.
Mean bolus delivery was within ±5% of target for both tested bolus sizes, but precision of individual boluses was higher with the larger boluses. Delivery times varied between the different pump models but agreed with the specifications of the respective manufacturers. Regarding basal rate accuracy, the total deviation for 72 h was very small in all pumps; however, larger deviations were observed during the first 12 h. For the patch pump, large variations between individual 1-h windows were observed.
In general, all compared insulin pump systems showed a similar level of accuracy. Differences, especially between durable pumps and the patch pump, were observed when considering each hour of basal rate delivery separately.

Real-Life Management and Effectiveness of Insulin Pump with or Without Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30900146/),"
To describe and compare the routine use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients with and without continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in routine clinical practice and its relationship with glycemic outcomes.
Retrospective observational case-control study collecting routine use of CSII and CGM in T1D patients between January 2016 and December 2016. Patients with T1D using sensor augmented pump (SAP) were matched by sex and disease duration in a 1:3 ratio with those treated only with CSII. Patients used a Paradigm Veo or 640G Medtronic-Minimed® insulin pump with or without a glucose sensor (Enlite, Medtronic-Minimed®) for at least 12 months.
A total of 160 subjects with T1D were included, 40 using SAP and 120 on CSII (age 47 ± 12 years, 88 women, diabetes duration 29 ± 9.0 years, 10 ± 4.7 years on CSII, HbA1C 7.6 ± 0.8%). Those in SAP therapy used the sensor 63% of time, performed less self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG)/day (3.3 ± 1.9 vs. 4.5 ± 2.0; p < 0.01), more bolus/day (6.2 ± 3.6 vs. 4.8 ± 1.6; p < 0.05), more basal insulin segment/day (6.5 ± 2.1 vs. 5.9 ± 1.5; p < 0.05), and more suspension time of the pump (97 ± 93 vs. 9.6 ± 20 min/day; p < 0.0001). Regarding metabolic control, SAP therapy patients had lower HbA1c (7.4 ± 0.7 vs. 7.7 ± 0.9%; p = 0.068), lower average SMBG value (151 ± 32 vs. 163 ± 30 mg/dL; p < 0.05), a lower percentage of SMBG values greater than 180 mg/dL (30 ± 19 vs. 37 ± 16%; p < 0.05) with no differences in SMBG values less than 70 mg/dL (12 ± 8.0 vs. 9.8 ± 9.8%; p = 0.33) compared with patients on CSII. There were no differences in bolus wizard targets or in insulin/carbohydrate ratios per day.
In a real-world setting, SAP therapy is associated with more self-adjustments of insulin therapy when compared to CSII alone. This could result in an improvement in glucose control.

Sudden death due to diabetic ketoacidosis following power failure of an insulin pump: Autopsy and pump data.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30856551/),"
To report a case in which autopsy findings and data from an insulin pump illustrate the course up to the death of a 31-year-old man with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus who was found dead in his apartment with his insulin pump disassembled and placed in another room.
Autopsy findings including histological, toxicological and biochemical examination are presented. Postmortem download of data from the insulin pump gave the history of the pump, which included blood glucose, insulin bolus, carbohydrate intake and the time course in the days to death, and the pump settings were recorded. For this case report, police reports on the death as well as hospital records were also reviewed.
At the patch for the insulin pump, nothing abnormal was found. Biochemical analysis showed glucose of 35 mmoL/L in vitreous humor fluid indicating antemortem hyperglycemia, and ketone bodies in the blood of 11.0 mmoL/L indicating ketoacidosis. Acute pulmonary hemostasis, chronic fat accumulation in the liver and acute fat accumulation in the kidneys were histological detected. There were no signs of late diabetic complications such as nephropathy or cardiovascular disease in the tissues. Insulin pump data showed that after three alarms, a power failure of the pump occurred leading to discontinuing insulin delivery, and about 48 h before the deceased was found dead, his body was depleted of insulin.
The cause of death is believed to be diabetic ketoacidosis due to completely lack of insulin because of power failure of the insulin pump, which therefore has been a decisive factor in the cascade of events that led to death. The case is, to our knowledge, the first to illustrate a death caused by diabetic ketoacidosis which is supported by autopsy findings and by data of an insulin pump up to the time of power failure. It is a strong example of usefulness of postmortem download of data from insulin pumps to help determine the cause of death among diabetics. Forensic pathologists should therefore review data and history of the pump systematically.

"District health board of residence, ethnicity and socioeconomic status all impact publicly funded insulin pump uptake in New Zealand patients with type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30845131/),"
Insulin pump therapy (CSII) is becoming increasingly common for those living with type 1 diabetes (T1D), and has been publicly funded in New Zealand since 2012. The aim of the current study was to examine national uptake of publicly funded pumps from 2012 to 2016, with a focus on the proportion of patients using pumps analysed according to district health board (DHB) as well as demographic characteristics.
Data from nationally held data collections including the New Zealand Virtual Diabetes Register were used to calculate the overall and subgroup proportions using pumps. Logistic regression analysis was then used to estimate the independent contributions of DHB of residence and sociodemographic characteristics to variations in pump use.
Between 2012 and 2016, CSII for those living with T1D (n=17,338) increased from 1.6 to 11.3% overall. However, speed of uptake differed by DHB of residence, ethnicity, degree of deprivation, age and gender. A four-fold difference in uptake between highest and lowest using DHBs was seen after adjusting for known confounders.
From 2012 to 2016 there has been a steadily increasing uptake of CSII. Despite publicly funded access, disparities in use appear to exist, including by DHB of residence as well as traditionally described socio-demographic barriers to healthcare. Efforts to understand and reduce these disparities are required.

"Insulin pump therapy, pre-pump hemoglobin A1c and metabolic improvement in children with type 1 diabetes at a tertiary Canadian children's hospital.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30779269/),"
Indications for insulin pump therapy (IPT) in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are relatively non-specific and therefore subject to provider discretion. Health professionals' perceptions of which people will have difficulty with IPT, for example, those with higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c ), may not be correct. This study examined the effect of IPT on HbA1c , and the role of pre-pump HbA1c on this effect.
All children with T1D started on IPT at British Columbia Children's Hospital from January 2011 through June 2016 were included if they had HbA1c values available both before and after IPT (n = 125). Generalized estimating equations was used to estimate the effects of IPT on HbA1c , stratified by pre-pump HbA1c levels (good: <7.5% [<58 mmol/mol], moderate: 7.5%-9.0% [58-75 mmol/mol], poor: >9.0% [>75 mmol/mol]).
After adjusting for potential confounders, mean HbA1c decreased by 0.48% [5.2 mmol/mol] (95% confidence interval: -0.64, -0.33% [-7.0, -3.6 mmol/mol]; P < 0.0001) after IPT initiation. The adjusted mean HbA1c decreased by 0.14% [1.5 mmol/mol] (-0.35, 0.07% [-3.8, 0.8 mmol/mol]; P = 0.188), 0.54% [5.9 mmol/mol] (-0.74, -0.34% [-8.1, -3.7 mmol/mol]; P < 0.0001), and 1.08% [11.8 mmol/mol] (-1.69, -0.46% [-18.5, -5.0 mmol/mol]; P = 0.0006) after pump initiation in the good, moderate, and poor pre-pump metabolic control groups, respectively.
Pre-pump HbA1c appears to play a significant role in the effects of IPT on HbA1c , with the largest decrease in HbA1c seen in the poor pre-pump HbA1c group. Eligibility and consideration for IPT should be expanded to routinely include these children.

"PERCEPTION OF GRADUATING ENDOCRINOLOGY, DIABETES, AND METABOLISM FELLOWS ON THE BENEFITS OF WEARING A CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITOR AND/OR INSULIN PUMP FOR THEIR EDUCATION.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30720336/),"

Objectives:
 To our knowledge, no prior research has explored the prevalence of wearing continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and/or insulin pumps among in-training fellows and their perception of doing so as part of their education. Our objectives therefore were to estimate the frequency with which wearing a CGM and/or insulin pump is used as a learning opportunity and explore the main motivators and perception on its value. 
Methods:
 A multiple-choice survey that addressed each fellow's level of training, type of fellowship training program, and use of CGM and/or insulin pump was sent to all Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education endocrinology, diabetes, and metabolism program coordinators or program directors. We asked them to forward this survey to their graduating fellows. Their perception on the value of wearing these devices was addressed. 
Results:
 Fifty-one graduating fellows responded to the survey; 78.43% and 62.5% of them wore a CGM and insulin pump, respectively. A total of 89.48% and 90% of those who wore a CGM and insulin pump, respectively, thought it was above-average value for their education, and the most common reasons were to learn the technical aspects and understand what patients with diabetes go through. 
Conclusion:
 Wearing a CGM and/or insulin pump is perceived by endocrinology graduating fellows as valuable to their education, specifically, to learn the technical aspects, understand the patient's experience, and develop empathy. Abbreviations: ACGME = Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education; CGM = continuous glucose monitor.

Real-World Costs of Continuous Insulin Pump Therapy and Multiple Daily Injections for Type 1 Diabetes: A Population-Based and Propensity-Matched Cohort From the Swedish National Diabetes Register.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30705062/),"
To investigate real-world costs of continuous insulin pump therapy compared with multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy for type 1 diabetes.
Individuals with type 1 diabetes and pump therapy in the Swedish National Diabetes Register (NDR) since 2002 were eligible. Control subjects on MDI were matched 2:1 using time-varying propensity scores. Longitudinal data on health care resource use, antidiabetes treatment, sickness absence, and early retirement were taken from national registers for 2005-2013. Mean annual costs were analyzed using univariate analysis. Regression analyses explored the role of sociodemographic factors. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed.
A total of 14,238 individuals with type 1 diabetes entered in the NDR between 2005 and 2013 (insulin pump n = 4,991, MDI n = 9,247, with switches allowed during the study) were included. Mean age at baseline was 34 years, with 21 years of diabetes duration and a mean HbA1c of 8.1% (65 mmol/mol). We had 73,920 person-years of observation with a mean follow-up of 5 years per participant. Mean annual costs were higher for pump therapy than for MDI therapy ($12,928 vs. $9,005, respectively; P < 0.001; mean difference $3,923 [95% CI $3,703-$4,143]). Health care costs, including medications and disposables, accounted for 73% of the costs for pump therapy and 63% of the costs for MDI therapy. Regression analyses showed higher costs for low education, low disposable income, women, and older age.
Nine years of real-world data on all measurable diabetes-related resource use show robust results for additional costs of insulin pump therapy in adults by subgroup and alternative propensity score specifications. Identification of tangible and intangible benefits of pump therapy over time remain important to support resource allocation decisions.

Comparing Insulin Pump Devices in Real Life: The AWeSoMe Study Group Prospective Experience.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30702335/),"
The use of insulin pumps in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) has expanded; however, data comparing devices remain scarce. We compared glycemic control, technical difficulties, and quality of life (QOL) between pump devices of three companies.
This prospective observational trial is based on clinical data retrieved during 12 months of follow-up of pediatric patients who started pump therapy as part of their clinical care in four medical centers. The devices fully reimbursed by the national health insurance are as follows: MiniMed™ 640G, MiniMed® Veo™, Animas® Vibe®, and Abbott OmniPod®. Parameters investigated included discontinuation rate, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), mean self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), total daily dose of insulin (TDD), pump setting parameters, body mass index (BMI), frequency of technical difficulties, significant skin reactions, and QOL.
Of 113 children (mean age 9.1 ± 4.1 years, 46% females), 68 (60%) used Medtronic devices, 33 (29%) OmniPod, and 12 (11%) Animas devices. Twelve percent of the cohort stopped using the pump during the study period, with no difference according to device. There were no differences between groups regarding mean SMBG values (P = 0.86), insulin TDD (P = 0.24), BMI (P = 0.87), level of insertion site pain or local reaction (P = 0.51), technical problems (P = 0.66), and QOL (P = 0.38). Changes in HbA1c from study initiation to end were also not statistically significant for any of the devices: from 7.99% ± 1.14% to 7.93% ± 0.99% for Medtronic, from 7.71% ± 1.29% to 7.92% ± 1.38% for OmniPod, and from 8.75% ± 1.3% to 7.70% ± 1.33% for Animas (P = 0.63).
Pump devices were comparable regarding glycemic control, weight gain, and satisfaction among pediatric patients with T1D.

Pediatric Endocrinology Trainees' Education and Knowledge About Insulin Pumps and Continuous Glucose Monitors.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30681363/),"
Recent data demonstrating a lack of improvement in average hemoglobin A1c levels despite the increased use of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) suggest that patients are not using these technologies optimally. Suboptimal provider understanding of these devices may be a contributing factor.
We sought to assess fellows' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding insulin pumps and CGMs using a mixed-methods survey. We polled 42 pediatric endocrinology fellows and 69 attending physicians in pediatric endocrinology using items on a five-point Likert scale.
Perceived fellow knowledge of insulin pumps and CGMs was only 3.6 ± 1.0 and 3.6 ± 0.9, respectively. Despite consensus about the need for pediatric endocrinologists to understand these technologies, only 14.7% of fellows reported the presence of a formal curriculum about these technologies at their institutions. Potential gaps identified in fellows' knowledge include general use and troubleshooting, advanced insulin pump features, infusion sets and dermatological complications, systematic approach to data, interpretation and application of CGM data, and keeping pace with technological advances.
Our data suggest suboptimal fellow knowledge and understanding of insulin pumps and CGMs in pediatric type 1 diabetes management, which is likely attributable to inadequate education in fellowship training programs. The development of formal educational curricula targeting areas of weakness identified in this survey may improve clinician knowledge of these technologies and ultimately impact patient education and care.

The International Diabetes Closed-Loop Study: Testing Artificial Pancreas Component Interoperability.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30649925/),"
Use of artificial pancreas (AP) requires seamless interaction of device components, such as continuous glucose monitor (CGM), insulin pump, and control algorithm. Mobile AP configurations also include a smartphone as computational hub and gateway to cloud applications (e.g., remote monitoring and data review and analysis). This International Diabetes Closed-Loop study was designed to demonstrate and evaluate the operation of the inControl AP using different CGMs and pump modalities without changes to the user interface, user experience, and underlying controller.
Forty-three patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) were enrolled at 10 clinical centers (7 United States, 3 Europe) and 41 were included in the analyses (39% female, >95% non-Hispanic white, median T1D duration 16 years, median HbA1c 7.4%). Two CGMs and two insulin pumps were tested by different study participants/sites using the same system hub (a smartphone) during 2 weeks of in-home use.
The major difference between the system components was the stability of their wireless connections with the smartphone. The two sensors achieved similar rates of connectivity as measured by percentage time in closed loop (75% and 75%); however, the two pumps had markedly different closed-loop adherence (66% vs. 87%). When connected, all system configurations achieved similar glycemic outcomes on AP control (73% [mean] time in range: 70-180 mg/dL, and 1.7% [median] time <70 mg/dL).
CGMs and insulin pumps can be interchangeable in the same Mobile AP system, as long as these devices achieve certain levels of reliability and wireless connection stability.

Impact of Insulin Injection and Infusion Routines on Lipohypertrophy and Glycemic Control in Children and Adults with Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30617932/),"
Proper insulin injection/infusion is essential to optimize insulin absorption and action. Guidelines on insulin injection techniques are available. Lipohypertrophy (LH) is a local complication of insulin therapy, which results in erratic absorption and impaired glycemic control.
Children and adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin injection or infusion were enrolled in the study. Subjects were interviewed and filled in a questionnaire on injection/infusion routines. Sites of injection/infusion were examined by trained diabetes educators, and capillary HbA1c was obtained.
One hundred sixty-nine subjects (104 children) with type 1 diabetes were enrolled; 119 were on multiple daily injection (MDI) and 50 on insulin pump therapy. Seventy-two percent and 82% of children and adults, respectively, rotate site at every injection; 78% of pump users change infusion set and 74% rotate site at 2-3 days. Thirty-nine percent and 32% of children and adults had LH. HbA1c was lower in children and adults with no LH (P < 0.001). An association was seen between LH and rotation frequency in children (P = 0.026). LH was the most common skin complication in the MDI group, while nodules, allergy marks and hyperpigmentation were seen in pump users.
Proper injection/infusion routines impact glycemic control and skin health. Education and examination of injection sites remain a crucial part of diabetes management.

BioChaperone Lispro versus faster aspart and insulin aspart in patients with type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: A randomized euglycemic clamp study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30565407/),"
We investigated the pharmacodynamics (PD) and pharmacokinetics (PK) of BioChaperone insulin Lispro (BCLIS), faster insulin aspart (FIA) and insulin aspart (ASP) in patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump. In this randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover glucose clamp study, 43 patients received a bolus dose of each insulin (0.15 U/kg) in addition to a basal rate (0.01 U/kg/h), delivered via an insulin pump. With BCLIS, the AUC-GIR,0-60 minutes (primary endpoint) was improved compared to ASP (least square means ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.44-1.88; P < 0.0001) and was similar compared to FIA (least square means ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94-1.18; P = 0.4609). BCLIS showed faster-on PD (tearly0.5GIRmax ) than ASP and faster-off PD (tlate0.5GIRmax ) than both FIA and ASP. BCLIS also demonstrated significantly higher early exposure (AUCins, 0-60 minutes) and lower late exposure (AUCins,120-600 minutes) than both other insulins. In patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump, BCLIS better mimics prandial insulin secretion and action than ASP and shows a faster off-PD than FIA.

Dysglycemia among youth with type 1 diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control in the Flexible Lifestyle Empowering Change trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30536572/),"
To examine the prevalence and correlates of non-severe hypoglycemia among adolescents with type 1 diabetes and suboptimal glycemic control, an understudied topic in this group.
Seven days of blinded continuous glucose monitor data were analyzed in 233 adolescents at baseline of the Flexible Lifestyle Empowering Change trial (13-16 years, type 1 diabetes duration >1 year, and hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] 8-13% [64-119 mmol]). Incidence of clinical hypoglycemia (54-69 mg/dL) and clinically serious hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL) was defined as number of episodes ≥15 minutes. Logistic regression modeling was used to determine the correlates of long duration of hypoglycemia, categorized by median split among those who experienced hypoglycemia.
The sample was 76.1% non-Hispanic white, 49.8% female, age = 14.9 ± 1.1 years, diabetes duration = 6.4 ± 3.7 years, and HbA1c = 9.6 ± 1.2% (81 ± 13 mmol/mol). Over 7 days, 79.4% of youth experienced ≥1 hypoglycemic episodes of <70 mg/dL, and 55.4% of youth experienced ≥1 hypoglycemic episodes of <54 mg/dL. Among all adolescents, the median duration of clinical hypoglycemia and clinically serious hypoglycemia was 21.9 (range 0-250.2) and 4.3 (range 0-209.7) minutes/day, respectively. Long duration of clinical hypoglycemia (range 1.8-17.4% time overall) and clinically serious hypoglycemia (range 1.2-14.6% time overall) was associated with older age and decreasing HbA1c. Long duration of clinically serious hypoglycemia also was associated with insulin pump use.
Almost 80% of adolescents with elevated HbA1c had an episode of clinical hypoglycemia, and >50% had clinically serious hypoglycemia in a week. Increased education alongside access to emerging diabetes technologies may help to prevent hypoglycemia while improving glycemic control.

Use of an Insulin Pump in the Elderly Surgical Patient: Tolerance of Total Pancreatectomy After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Multifocal Pancreatic Cancer.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30788460/),"
Introduction: Pancreatic cancer is one of the most fatal cancers if not caught early and is associated with late disease presentation. Multifocal pancreatic cancer is particularly difficult to treat as cases that are amenable to surgical resection require total pancreatectomy. Such patients will develop brittle diabetes as they require exogenous insulin after surgery and in the apancreatic state lose counter-regulatory homeostatic mechanisms (i.e., glucagon). We present an elderly patient who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and total pancreatectomy. The patient has adequate glycemic control postoperatively being managed with an insulin pump and remains disease free at 3 years and 3 months after resection. Case Presentation: A 72-year-old male presented with two tumors, in the head and tail of the pancreas, respectively, which were consistent with pancreatic adenocarcinoma by endoscopic ultrasound biopsy. Neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX had been administered and total pancreatectomy was performed. The patient did well postoperatively and was discharged on postoperative day 8. The patient was seen by endocrinology pre- and postoperatively who started an insulin pump for glycemic management 2 weeks postoperatively. The patient's HbA1c was 7.9% at 3 months. The patient remains disease free at 3 years and 3 months with an HbA1c of 7.0% and a normal CA19-9. Conclusion: This case highlights that glycemic control after total pancreatectomy with the use of an insulin pump in the elderly population is achievable. Elderly patients can struggle with certain technologies and selecting appropriate patients for insulin pump therapy after total pancreatectomy is imperative.

Disparities in Insulin Pump Therapy Persist in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes Despite Rising Overall Pump Use Rates.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30581163/),"
This study sought to determine if disparities in insulin pump therapy among youth with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) persist despite recent increases in overall pump use rates.
All patients aged 6 months-17 years, diagnosed with T1DM, and completed 4+ outpatient diabetes visits at an academically-affiliated pediatric health care center from 2011 to 2016 were identified (n = 2131). Data were collected from existing electronic medical records and a multivariable logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with insulin pump therapy.
Findings revealed one novel factor (patients/families whose primary language is Spanish [OR 0.47, p = 0.038] or other non-English languages [OR 0.47, p = 0.028]) and confirmed several previously known factors associated with lower insulin pump use: patients who were older (10-14 years OR 0.38, p < 0.0001; 15+ years OR 0.15, p < 0.0001), male (OR 0.80, p = 0.021), non-Hispanic black (OR 0.59, p = 0.009), American Indian/Alaska Native (OR 0.19, p = 0.023), had either government (OR 0.42, p < 0.0001) or no insurance (OR 0.52, p = 0.004) and poor glycemic control (at least one HbA1c ≥ 8.5%; OR 0.54, p < 0.0001).
Significant disparities in insulin pump use in youth with T1DM persist despite known benefits associated with pump therapy and underlying causes remain unclear.
Health care providers should explore barriers to insulin pump therapy, including limited English language proficiency.

Design and Clinical Evaluation of the Interoperable Artificial Pancreas System (iAPS) Smartphone App: Interoperable Components with Modular Design for Progressive Artificial Pancreas Research and Development.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30547670/),"
There is an unmet need for a modular artificial pancreas (AP) system for clinical trials within the existing regulatory framework to further AP research projects from both academia and industry. We designed, developed, and tested the interoperable artificial pancreas system (iAPS) smartphone app that can interface wirelessly with leading continuous glucose monitors (CGM), insulin pump devices, and decision-making algorithms while running on an unlocked smartphone.
After algorithm verification, hazard and mitigation analysis, and complete system verification of iAPS, six adults with type 1 diabetes completed 1 week of sensor-augmented pump (SAP) use followed by 48 h of AP use with the iAPS, a Dexcom G5 CGM, and either a Tandem or Insulet insulin pump in an investigational device exemption study. The AP system was challenged by participants performing extensive walking without exercise announcement to the controller, multiple large meals eaten out at restaurants, two overnight periods, and multiple intentional connectivity interruptions.
Even with these intentional challenges, comparison of the SAP phase with the AP study showed a trend toward improved time in target glucose range 70-180 mg/dL (78.8% vs. 83.1%; P = 0.31), and a statistically significant reduction in time below 70 mg/dL (6.1% vs. 2.2%; P = 0.03). The iAPS system performed reliably and showed robust connectivity with the peripheral devices (99.8% time connected to CGM and 94.3% time in closed loop) while requiring limited user intervention.
The iAPS system was safe and effective in regulating glucose levels under challenging conditions and is suitable for use in unconstrained environments.

Effect of predicted low suspend pump treatment on improving glycaemic control and quality of sleep in children with type 1 diabetes and their caregivers: the QUEST randomized crossover study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30509293/),"
In attempting to achieve optimal metabolic control, the day-to-day management is challenging for a child with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and his family and can have a major negative impact on their quality of life. Augmenting an insulin pump with glucose sensor information leads to improved outcomes: decreased haemoglobin A1c levels, increased time in glucose target and less hypoglycaemia. Fear of nocturnal hypoglycaemia remains pervasive amongst parents, leading to chronic sleep interruption and lack of sleep for the parents and their children. The QUEST study, an open-label, single-centre randomized crossover study, aims to evaluate the impact on time in target, in hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and the effect on sleep and quality of life in children with T1D, comparing a sensor-augmented pump (SAP) with predictive low glucose suspend and alerts to the use of the same insulin pump with a flash glucose measurement (FGM) device not interacting with the pump.
Subjects meeting the inclusion criteria are randomized to treatment with the SAP or treatment with an insulin pump and independent FGM for 5 weeks. Following a 3-week washout period, the subjects cross over to the other study arm for 5 weeks. During the week before and in the last week of treatment, the subjects and one of their caregivers wear a sleep monitor in order to obtain sleep data. The primary endpoint is the between-arm difference in percentage of time in glucose target during the final 6 days of each treatment arm, measured by a blinded continuous glucose measurement (CGM). Additional endpoints include comparison of quantity and quality of sleep as well as quality of life perception of the subjects and one of their caregivers in the two different treatment arms. Recruitment started in February 2017. A total of 36 patients are planned to be randomized. The study recruitment was completed in April 2018.
With this study we will provide more information on whether insulin pump treatment combined with more technology (SmartGuard® feature and alerts) leads to better metabolic control. The inclusion of indicators on quality of sleep with less sleep interruption, less lack of sleep and perception of quality of life in both children and their primary caregivers is essential for this study and might help to guide us to further treatment improvement.

"Insulin Pump in Difficult to Control Type 2 Diabetes: A Single Center, Five Years' Experience.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30410846/),"
Objective Due to a progressive decline in beta-cell function, a considerable number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) ultimately require multiple daily injections of large doses of insulin for glycemic control. Majority of studies have reported only short-term benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an insulin pump in T2D. Our five-year follow-up data of CSII in T2D is one of the few studies showing persistent benefit in glucose control in this population. Research design and methods We did a chart review of patients treated with an insulin pump for five years. Inclusion criteria were: type 2 diabetes, 18-75 years of age, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) more than 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) on multiple doses of insulin (MDI > four injections per day) or more than 100 units of insulin/day, wide glycemic excursions, and intractable hypoglycemia. We identified a total of 13 patients. The primary endpoint wasÂ change in HbA1c from baseline to five years. We also reviewed the difference in weight, basal insulin requirements, hypoglycemia, and patient satisfaction questionnaire at one year. Exclusion criteria were: type 1 diabetes (T1D) and pregnancy. Results The HbA1c at five years was found to be 7.72% (61 mmol/mol) compared to a baseline of 8.89% (74 mmol/mol), p-value 0.0076. We did not find any increased risk of severe hypoglycemia, weight gain, and insulin requirement. Conclusions The beneficial effect of insulin pump persisted for five years of follow-up, suggesting it as a valuable treatment option for difficult to treat T2D.

Pumps or Multiple Daily Injections in Pregnancy Involving Type 1 Diabetes: A Prespecified Analysis of the CONCEPTT Randomized Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30327362/),"
To compare glycemic control, quality of life, and pregnancy outcomes of women using insulin pumps and multiple daily injection therapy (MDI) during the Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Women With Type 1 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial (CONCEPTT).
This was a prespecified analysis of CONCEPTT involving 248 pregnant women from 31 centers. Randomization was stratified for pump versus MDI and HbA1c. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c from randomization to 34 weeks' gestation. Key secondary outcomes were continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) measures, maternal-infant health, and patient-reported outcomes.
At baseline, pump users were more often in stable relationships (P = 0.003), more likely to take preconception vitamins (P = 0.03), and less likely to smoke (P = 0.02). Pump and MDI users had comparable first-trimester glycemia: HbA1c 6.84 ± 0.71 vs. 6.95 ± 0.58% (51 ± 7.8 vs. 52 ± 6.3 mmol/mol) (P = 0.31) and CGM time in target (51 ± 14 vs. 50 ± 13%) (P = 0.40). At 34 weeks, MDI users had a greater decrease in HbA1c (-0.55 ± 0.59 vs. -0.32 ± 0.65%, P = 0.001). At 24 and 34 weeks, MDI users were more likely to achieve target HbA1c (P = 0.009 and P = 0.001, respectively). Pump users had more hypertensive disorders (P = 0.011), mainly driven by increased gestational hypertension (14.4 vs. 5.2%; P = 0.025), and more neonatal hypoglycemia (31.8 vs. 19.1%, P = 0.05) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions >24 h (44.5 vs. 29.6%; P = 0.02). Pump users had a larger reduction in hypoglycemia-related anxiety (P = 0.05) but greater decline in health/well-being (P = 0.02).
In CONCEPTT, MDI users were more likely to have better glycemic outcomes and less likely to have gestational hypertension, neonatal hypoglycemia, and NICU admissions than pump users. These data suggest that implementation of insulin pump therapy is potentially suboptimal during pregnancy.

Effectiveness of artificial pancreas in the non-adult population: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30321535/),"
Artificial pancreas is a technology that minimizes user input by bridging continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump treatment, and has proven safety in the adult population. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of closed-loop (CL) systems in the glycemic control of non-adult type 1 diabetes patients in both a pairwise and network meta-analysis (NMA) context and investigate various parameters potentially affecting the outcome.
Literature was systematically searched using the MEDLINE (1966-2018), Scopus (2004-2018), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (1999-2018), Clinicaltrials.gov (2008-2018) and Google Scholar (2004-2018) databases. Studies comparing the glycemic control in CL (either single- or dual-hormone) with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in people with diabetes (PWD) aged <18 years old were deemed eligible. The primary outcome analysis was conducted with regard to time spent in the target glycemic range. All outcomes were evaluated in NMA in order to investigate potential between-algorithm differences. Pairwise meta-analysis and meta-regression were performed using the RevMan 5.3 and Open Meta-Analyst software. For NMA, the package pcnetmetain R 3.5.1 was used.
The meta-analysis was based on 25 studies with a total of 504 PWD. The CL group was associated with significantly higher percentage of time spent in the target glycemic range (Mean (SD): 67.59% (SD: 8.07%) in the target range and OL PWD spending 55.77% (SD: 11.73%), MD: -11.97%, 95% CI [-18.40, -5.54%]) and with lower percentages of time in hyperglycemia (MD: 3.01%, 95% CI [1.68, 4.34%]) and hypoglycemia (MD: 0.67%, 95% CI [0.21, 1.13%]. Mean glucose was also decreased in the CL group (MD: 0.75 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.18-1.33]). The NMA arm of the study showed that the bihormonal modality was superior to other algorithms and standard treatment in lowering mean glucose and increasing time spent in the target range. The DiAs platform was superior to PID in controlling hypoglycemia and mean glucose. Time in target range and mean glucose were unaffected by the confounding factors tested.
The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that artificial pancreas systems are superior to the standard sensor-augmented pump treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in non-adult PWD. Between-algorithm differences are also addressed, implying a superiority of the bihormonal treatment modality. Future large-scale studies are needed in the field to verify these outcomes and to determine the optimal algorithm to be used in the clinical setting.

Efficacy of an Education Program for People With Diabetes and Insulin Pump Treatment (INPUT): Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30305343/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is the most advanced form of insulin delivery, but it requires structured education to provide users with the necessary knowledge/skills and to support their motivation. Currently, no structured education program designed to provide this training has been evaluated. We developed a CSII-specific, structured education program (Insulin Pump Treatment [INPUT]) and evaluated its impact on glycemic control, behavior, and psychosocial status.
This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel trial with a 6-month follow-up. Eligible participants (age 16-75 years) currently were treated with insulin pump therapy. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to the INPUT program or to usual care using a computer-generated algorithm, with study center as the stratification factor. The primary outcome was HbA1c change from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes were incidence of severe hypoglycemia and changes in behavioral and psychosocial measures.
Between 1 April 2016 and 26 April 2016, 268 people with diabetes and a mean duration of CSII therapy of 9.5 years were randomly assigned to the INPUT group (n = 135) or control group (n = 133). At 6 months, HbA1c improved in the INPUT group (8.33 ± 0.8 vs. 8.04 ± 0.9; P < 0.0001) but not in the control group (8.33 ± 1.0 vs. 8.27 ± 1.0; P = 0.11). The between-group difference in HbA1c reduction was significant, favoring INPUT (-0.28% vs. -0.06%, Δ -0.22%, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06; P = 0.0029). The incidence rate ratio of severe hypoglycemia was 3.55 times higher for participants in the control group than for those in the INPUT group (95% CI 1.50-8.43; P = 0.0041).
The INPUT education program led to a significant improvement in glycemic control and incidence of severe hypoglycemia in insulin pump users.

Attitudes and habits of patients with type 1 diabetes during fasting Ramadan.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30294552/),"
Fasting Ramadan is associated with changes in lifestyle patterns of patients with diabetes who choose to perform fasting. We aimed to determine the attitude and habits of patients with type 1 diabetes during fasting Ramadan.
The study comprised a prospective cohort of patients with type 1 diabetes who were on insulin pump or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) regimen. Patient questionnaires included the frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), the need to make changes in insulin regimen by patients, timings of insulin administration, performing carbohydrate counting and levels of physical activity.
A total of 156 patients were studied (61 patients on insulin pump and 95 patients on MDI). Patients on pump therapy performed SMBG more frequently than those on MDI regimen (4.8 ± 1.4 and 3.7 ± 1.7 times per day, respectively, P = 0.001) and were more likely to perform carbohydrate counting (32.7% and 8.4% of pump and MDI patients, respectively, P < 0.001). There was no difference in the percentage of patients who made changes in insulin doses (74.5% of the pump group and 77.3% of MDI patients) or those who had any level of physical activity (12.5% of the pump group and 21.1% of the MDI group). The timing of administering meal insulin in relation to sunset meal was variable with a preference to taking the injection immediately at sunset. There was no difference in glucose control between both groups as measured by frucotsamine levels or the number of days that patients have to stop fasting.
Fasting Ramadan is associated with significant and variable changes in the attitude and behaviors of patients with type 1 diabetes with no difference in glucose control between patients on insulin pump or MDI regimen. Further studies are needed to define the role of education and its effect on these attitudes and patient care in this population.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01941238.

"Closed-loop insulin delivery in suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes: a multicentre, 12-week randomised trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30292578/),"
The achievement of glycaemic control remains challenging for patients with type 1 diabetes. We assessed the effectiveness of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy in people with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes aged 6 years and older.
In this open-label, multicentre, multinational, single-period, parallel randomised controlled trial, participants were recruited from diabetes outpatient clinics at four hospitals in the UK and two centres in the USA. We randomly assigned participants with type 1 diabetes aged 6 years and older treated with insulin pump and with suboptimal glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] 7·5-10·0%) to receive either hybrid closed-loop therapy or sensor-augmented pump therapy over 12 weeks of free living. Training on study insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring took place over a 4-week run-in period. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned using central randomisation software. Allocation to the two study groups was unblinded, and randomisation was stratified within centre by low (<8·5%) or high (≥8·5%) HbA1c. The primary endpoint was the proportion of time that glucose concentration was within the target range of 3·9-10·0 mmol/L at 12 weeks post randomisation. Analyses of primary outcome and safety measures were done in all randomised patients. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02523131, and is closed to accrual.
From May 12, 2016, to Nov 17, 2017, 114 individuals were screened, and 86 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive hybrid closed-loop therapy (n=46) or sensor-augmented pump therapy (n=40; control group). The proportion of time that glucose concentration was within the target range was significantly higher in the closed-loop group (65%, SD 8) compared with the control group (54%, SD 9; mean difference in change 10·8 percentage points, 95% CI 8·2 to 13·5; p<0·0001). In the closed-loop group, HbA1c was reduced from a screening value of 8·3% (SD 0·6) to 8·0% (SD 0·6) after the 4-week run-in, and to 7·4% (SD 0·6) after the 12-week intervention period. In the control group, the HbA1c values were 8·2% (SD 0·5) at screening, 7·8% (SD 0·6) after run-in, and 7·7% (SD 0·5) after intervention; reductions in HbA1c percentages were significantly greater in the closed-loop group compared with the control group (mean difference in change 0·36%, 95% CI 0·19 to 0·53; p<0·0001). The time spent with glucose concentrations below 3·9 mmol/L (mean difference in change -0·83 percentage points, -1·40 to -0·16; p=0·0013) and above 10·0 mmol/L (mean difference in change -10·3 percentage points, -13·2 to -7·5; p<0·0001) was shorter in the closed-loop group than the control group. The coefficient of variation of sensor-measured glucose was not different between interventions (mean difference in change -0·4%, 95% CI -1·4% to 0·7%; p=0·50). Similarly, total daily insulin dose was not different (mean difference in change 0·031 U/kg per day, 95% CI -0·005 to 0·067; p=0·09) and bodyweight did not differ (mean difference in change 0·68 kg, 95% CI -0·34 to 1·69; p=0·19). No severe hypoglycaemia occurred. One diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in the closed-loop group due to infusion set failure. Two participants in each study group had significant hyperglycaemia, and there were 13 other adverse events in the closed-loop group and three in the control group.
Hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery improves glucose control while reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia across a wide age range in patients with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes.

Summarize biopsychosocial factors associated with using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), insulin pumps, and artificial pancreas (AP) systems and provide a ""call to the field"" about their importance to technology uptake and maintained use.
Insulin pumps and CGMs are becoming standard of care for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). AP systems combining a CGM, insulin pump, and automated dosing algorithm are available for commercial use. Despite improved glycemic control with AP system use, numerous barriers exist which may limit their benefit. Studies on components of AP systems (pumps, CGMs) are limited and demonstrate mixed results of their impact on fear of hypoglycemia, adherence, quality of life, depression and anxiety, and diabetes distress. Studies examining biopsychological factors associated specifically with sustained use of AP systems are also sparse. Biological, psychological and social impacts of AP systems have been understudied and the information they provide has not been capitalized upon.

Although conventional therapy effectively raises serum calcium, it bypasses the potent calcium reabsorption effects of PTH on the kidney which leads to hypercalciuria and an increased risk of nephrocalcinosis and renal insufficiency. Twenty-five years ago, we launched the first systematic investigation into synthetic human PTH 1-34 replacement therapy in both adults and children. These studies led to our current understanding of the complex nature of PTH 1-34 therapy and to the challenges we still face in our pursuit of a safe and effective physiologic replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism. The normalization and minimal fluctuation of serum and urine calcium levels were the primary management goals. As the frequency of PTH 1-34 injections increased, the total daily dose required to normalize calcium homeostasis decreased and episodes of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria diminished, producing a more physiologic biochemical profile. Twice-daily injections achieved simultaneous normalization of serum and urine calcium levels in many patients but the persistent elevation of bone markers and the difficulty in reducing urine calcium to normal levels in the more severe cases, suggested an alternative to PTH 1-34 injections was needed. The studies with PTH 1-34 delivered by insulin pump represent an important advance in the management of hypoparathyroidism. PTH 1-34 delivered by insulin pump normalized serum and urine calcium and markers of bone turnover. Additionally, pump delivery of PTH 1-34 produced stable magnesium values within the normal range and reduced magnesium excretion. Currently, PTH 1-34 delivery by pump is the only alternative to PTH injections that has been tested in both adults and children and proven to achieve a physiologic biochemical profile.

Mealtime insulin bolus adherence and glycemic control in adolescents on insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30238153/),"
Poor self-management contributes to insufficient glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). We assessed the effects on glycemic control of adherence to self-measurement of blood glucose (SMBG) and insulin boluses in 90 adolescents with T1DM on insulin pump therapy over a 2-month period. We compared the number of insulin boluses and SMBGs around main meals to the ""gold standard"" of optimal diabetes management (SMBGs and a bolus before each main meal and SMBG before bedtime). The mean (95% CI) HbA1c levels were 2.9(1.7 to 4.0) mmol/mol lower for every additional insulin bolus and 3.1(1.6 to 4.5) mmol/mol lower for every additional SMBG. Patients performing SMBG and bolusing around each main meal had considerably lower HbA1c levels than those unable to do (95% CI for difference 4.3 to 10.4 mmol/mol and 11.5 to 20.1 mmol/mol respectively). For each additional mealtime bolus/day, the odds ratio of achieving target HbA1c levels of <58 mmol/mol was 6.73 (95% CI 2.94-15.38), after adjustment for gender, age, diabetes duration, and affective responses to SMBG in a multiple logistic regression model.Conclusion: Glycemic control in adolescents with T1DM on insulin pump therapy is strongly dependent on adherence to insulin boluses around mealtimes. What is Known: • In mixed groups of children and adolescents, insulin bolus frequency and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) frequency were determinants of HbA1c levels. • Adherence to insulin boluses and SMBG is particularly challenging in adolescents. What is New: • In adolescents on insulin pump therapy, each additional insulin bolus, particularly around mealtime, was significantly associated with approximately 3 mmol/mol lower HbA1c levels. • This beneficial effect of mealtime bolusing was strongest for the evening meal.

Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Characteristics in Type 1 Diabetes Children and Adolescents in Qatar.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30220038/),"
To describe continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) characteristics in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) children and adolescents using a standardized protocol in routine clinical settings in Qatar.
A total of 138 T1DM patients (62 males; 76 females; mean age 9.8 ± 3.4 years) with a mean diabetes duration of 2.4 ± 1.9 years initiated CSII (MiniMed® Veo®™ and MiniMed® 640 G insulin pumps; Medtronic, Northridge, CA, USA) in 2016 and 2017. CSII characteristics and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were evaluated 1 year after treatment initiation.
At 1 year after treatment initiation, the insulin dose had significantly increased (from 0.59 ± 0.23 to 0.74 ± 0.26 U/kg body weight per 24; P < 0.05), and the HbA1c level had significantly decreased (from 9.7 ± 1.3 to 8.1 ± 0.6%; P < 0.05). More than 92% of patients used the Bolus Wizard feature of the insulin pump at the following settings: insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio 19.2 ± 9.3 g; insulin sensitivity factor 131 ± 68 mg/dl; target range 91 ± 9.3-135 ± 14.2 mg/dl; active insulin time 3.8 ± 0.8 h.
Our results show that CSII may significantly improve glucose control in T1D children and adolescents who use a standardized protocol. A reduction of HbA1c by - 1.6% was achieved at 1 year after CSII initiation. These results need to be confirmed in a study with a longer duration.

Health-related quality of life of adolescents with type 1 diabetes in the context of resilience.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30203556/),"
Adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) can be faced with deterioration in glycemic control (GC), reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and other psychosocial problems. It is important to understand how the disease and its clinical conditions influence HRQoL and how adolescents are able to overcome the life adjustment difficulties.
To assess HRQoL of adolescents with T1D from demographic, clinical, personal, and behavioral point of view.
A total of 229 adolescents with T1D (51.2% males) with a mean age of 15.35 (2.29) years old were recruited from three diabetes centers. The mean diabetes duration was 7.48 (3.87), the mean hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) level was 10.3 (1.76) mmol/L.
A multicenter quantitative correlational design study was applied to investigate the influence of sex, age, diabetes duration, GC expressed by HbA1c, intensive insulin regimen, physical activity (PA), resilience (RS), and socioeconomic background on HRQoL.
Presence of the diabetes symptoms and worry about the disease has negative impact on the patients' HRQoL. Stepwise multiple regression analyses indicated that insulin pump therapy, male sex, and higher level of RS were significantly related to an increase in HRQoL, whereas the higher level of PA, male sex, and better HRQoL was significantly related to positive change in RS. Patients treated with insulin pump therapy had significantly better HRQoL.
Significant association can be observed between HRQoL and RS. Supposedly, higher level of PA promotes higher level of RS that in turn helps increase HRQoL in adolescents with T1D. Treatment with insulin pump therapy also promotes better HRQoL.

How Many Grays to Get to the Malfunction of Insulin Pumps? Determining the Effects of Radiation on Insulin Pump Function.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30175594/),"
The primary objective was to determine if exposure to radiation has an effect on insulin pump function.
Four donated insulin pumps were filled with saline and set to identical program modes. They were attached together with a dosimeter and exposed to repeat CT scans.
Insulin Pump 1 experienced a ""Prime"" alarm and a darkened screen during CT scan radiation exposure; this pump was removed from further radiation exposure after 6 CT scans. Insulin Pumps 2, 3, and 4 all continued to receive 34 more consecutive CT scan exposures with no significant alarms, failures, or malfunctions. Insulin Pump 4 experienced ""Low Battery"" and ""Stuck Button"" alarms, both of which were easily fixed. Insulin Pumps 2, 3, and 4 received a total of at least 8576 mrem from 34 CT scans worth of radiation without any significant alarms, malfunctions, or failures. Insulin Pump 1 was monitored after being removed from the study and continued to function normally with the darkened screen.
It cannot be determined whether Insulin Pump 1 had minor malfunctions due to repetitive use as a demonstration model or due to the radiation exposure. Insulin Pumps 2, 3, and 4 were monitored for 2 additional months following radiation exposure and continued to function normally. Further research studies with a larger number of insulin pumps are warranted to determine the true effect of radiation exposure on insulin pump function.

"Diabetes Device Use and Glycemic Control among Youth with Type 1 Diabetes: A Single-Center, Cross-Sectional Study.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30151393/),"
The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine the rates of diabetes device use (insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM)) and association with glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes in a large, diverse pediatric center.
Demographic and clinical data were obtained from 1992 patients who met the eligibility criteria (age < 26 years, diabetes duration ≥ 1 year, and ≥1 clinic visit in the preceding 12 months). Statistical analyses assessed the likelihood of device use based on demographic characteristics and the association between device use and glycemic control based on most recent hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).
Mean age was 13.8 ± 4.2 years, 50.7% were female, diabetes duration was 6.2 ± 4 years, and mean HbA1c was 8.7 ± 1.8%. Overall, 38.2% of patients were on pump therapy and 18.5% were on CGM. Patients who were non-Hispanic (NH) white, privately insured, and with primary English-speaking parent(s) had higher rates of insulin pump use, as well as CGM use (P < 0.001 for both). Female patients had higher rates of pump use only (P < 0.01). Private health insurance, NH white race/ethnicity, and CGM use were each associated with lower HbA1c (P = 0.03, <0.001, and <0.008, resp.).
At a large, diverse, pediatric diabetes center, disparities in diabetes device use were present across sex, race/ethnicity, health insurance coverage, and primary language of parent(s). CGM use was associated with lower HbA1c. Quality improvement efforts are underway to ensure improved access, education, and clinical programs for advanced diabetes devices for T1D patients.

The aim of the study was to evaluate Facebook group as possible communication tool to improve glucose control in adolescents and young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
This retrospective and cross-sectional study included 728 T1D patients (age 11-25) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI) treated at the center for insulin pump and glucose sensor in Skopje from January 2012 to December 2017. Data were collected through the electronic medical record system and cross-sectional analysis (telephone, social media (Facebook and Viber) or email). Patients were analyzed in two groups: (a) non-Internet group, with 398 patients treated using standard medical protocol with regular clinic visits; (b) Internet group, with 330 patients who, besides standard medical protocol, were active members of a national closed Facebook group on diabetes. Both the non-Internet and Internet groups had regular visits every 2-3 months. Patients from the Internet group were members of the closed Facebook group ""Diabetes Macedonia"" and had an opportunity to interact with questions, answers, and comments on diabetes care. An additional analysis was performed of the Internet group on combined use of Facebook and Viber. Average HbA1c levels were compared in both groups.
Each patient from the Facebook group had 1.5 ± 3.5 posts per day. Hba1c was significantly lower in patients from the Internet group (7.1 ± 3.2%; 54 ± 35 mmol/mol) compared to patients from the non-Internet group (7.6 ± 2.8%; 60 ± 31 mmol/mol).
Social media like Facebook and Viber can be additional communication tool in adolescents and young people with T1D and can significantly lower HbA1c compared to patients without social media use. CSII patients are more likely to use both social media (Facebook and Viber) compared with MDI patients (Facebook only).

Real-world outcomes of insulin pump compared to injection therapy in a population-based sample of children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30129154/),"
Long-term glycemic outcomes in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) with appropriate control data are limited. Randomized controlled studies of technology in diabetes care are generally limited in duration and likely to have a selection bias. Hence, evaluation of population-based data provides a robust alternative evaluation of the benefits of insulin pump therapy.
To investigate the outcomes of insulin pump therapy, as compared to injection therapy, in children with T1D attending a state-wide diabetes service in Western Australia.
Patients using insulin pump therapy between January 1999 and July 2016 were matched to patients on injection therapy on the basis of age, date of diagnosis, and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) at the start of pump therapy.
A total of 513 pump-injection matches were identified. The pump cohort had a significantly lower mean HbA1c for the first 6 years of follow-up. The difference in HbA1c between the cohorts was observed by 6 months (3 mmol/mol [0.3%], standard error of the mean (SEM) 0.05, N = 463 matched pairs, P < 0.001) and was sustained with the greatest difference in HbA1c at 6 years (4 mmol/mol [0.4%], SEM 0.21, N = 112 matched pairs, P = 0.04). Beyond 6 years of follow-up, the HbA1c was not significantly lower in the pump cohort (N < 70 matched pairs).
Patients using insulin pump therapy had a better long-term glycemic control relative to the matched injection therapy cohort. Large population-based cohort studies using real-world data provide a valuable perspective on evaluation of new technologies in children with T1D.

An Overview of Safety Issues on Use of Insulin Pumps and Continuous Glucose Monitoring Systems in the Hospital.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30120619/),"
Summarize safety issues related to patients using insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) in the outpatient setting when they are hospitalized and to review steps that can be taken to mitigate risk associated with use or discontinuation of these devices.
Two recent consensus conferences were held on the topics of inpatient use of insulin pumps and CGMS devices. In addition to commonly known safety issues (e.g., device malfunction, infection), cybersecurity and the vulnerability of contemporary technology to hacking have emerged. CGMS capabilities offer the promise of advancing the goal for development of glucometry (centralized monitoring of real-time glucose data). Strategies to assuring safe use of insulin pumps and CGMS in the hospital include collaboration between the patient and staff, proper patient selection, and clear policies and procedures outlining safe use. Available data indicates few adverse events associated with these devices in the hospital. Current data suggests, with proper patient selection and a clear process in place for glycemic management, that adverse events are rare, and consensus favors allowing use of the technology in the hospital. The topic of insulin pump and CGMS in the hospital would greatly benefit from more institutions reporting on their experiences and prospective clinical trials.

Effect of 6 months hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery in young people with type 1 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial protocol.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30104309/),"
Automated insulin delivery (also known as closed loop, or artificial pancreas) has shown potential to improve glycaemic control and quality of life in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Automated insulin delivery devices incorporate an insulin pump with continuous glucose monitoring(CGM) and an algorithm, and adjust insulin in real time. This study aims to establish the safety and efficacy of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) system in a long-term outpatient trial in people with T1D aged 12 -<25 years of age, and compare outcomes with standard therapy for T1D as used in the contemporary community.
This is an open-label, multicentre, 6-month, randomised controlled home trial to test the MiniMed Medtronic 670G system (HCL) in people with T1D aged 12 -<25 years, and compare it to standard care (multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), with or without CGM). Following a run-in period including diabetes and carbohydrate counting education, dosage optimisation and baseline glucose control data collection, participants are randomised to either HCL or to continue on their current treatment regimen. The primary aim of the study is to compare the proportion of time spent in target sensor glucose range (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) on HCL versus standard therapy. Secondary aims include a range of glucose control parameters, psychosocial measures, health economic measures, biomarker status, user/technology interactions and healthcare professional expectations. Analysis will be intention to treat. A study in adults with an aligned design is being conducted in parallel to this trial.
Ethics committee permissions were gained from respective institutional review boards. The findings of the study will provide high-quality evidence on the role of HCL in clinical practice.

Is insulin pump therapy effective in Type 1 diabetes?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30098219/),"
There continues to be uncertainty about the effectiveness in Type 1 diabetes of insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII) vs. multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). This narrative review discusses the reasons for this uncertainty, summarizes the current evidence base for CSII and suggests some future research needs. There are difficulties in interpreting trials of CSII because effectiveness varies widely due to factors such as differing baseline control, suboptimal use of best CSII practices, and psychological factors, for example, high external locus of control, non-adherence and lack of motivation. Many summary meta-analyses are also misleading because of poor trial selection (e.g. short duration, obsolete pumps, low baseline rate of hypoglycaemia) and reliance on mean effect size for decision-making. Both MDI and CSII can achieve strict glycaemic control without hypoglycaemia in some people with Type 1 diabetes, especially those who are motivated and have undergone structured diabetes education, and with high levels of ongoing input from healthcare professionals. CSII is particularly effective in those people with Type 1 diabetes who have not achieved target HbA1c levels without disabling hypoglycaemia using best attempts with MDI, and here there can be valuable and substantial improvement. Insulin pumps are safe, effective and accepted when used in newly diagnosed diabetes, particularly in children, where MDI may not be practicable. Future research needs include more studies on mortality associated with insulin pumps where registry data have suggested lower rates vs. MDI; and psychological strategies to improve non-adherence and suboptimal glycaemic outcomes on CSII.

The 30-year cost-effectiveness of alternative strategies to achieve excellent glycemic control in type 1 diabetes: An economic simulation informed by the results of the diabetes control and complications trial/epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications (DCCT/EDIC).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30064713/),"
To simulate the cost-effectiveness of historical and modern treatment scenarios that achieve excellent vs. poor glycemic control in type 1 diabetes (T1DM).
We describe and compare the costs of intensive and conventional therapies for T1DM as performed during DCCT, and modern intensive and basic therapy scenarios using insulin analogs, pens, pumps, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to achieve excellent or poor glycemic control. We then assess the differences in treatment costs and the costs of outcomes over 30 years and report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
Over 30 years, DCCT intensive therapy cost $127,500 to $181,600 more per participant than DCCT conventional therapy, and modern intensive therapy cost $87,700 to $409,000 more per individual than modern basic therapy. Excellent glycemic control averted as much as $90,900 in costs from complications and added ~1.62 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per participant over 30 years. When costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually, DCCT intensive therapy and modern intensive therapies that use multiple daily injections (MDI) or pumps are cost-saving or cost-effective (<$100,000/QALY-gained). If applied to all patients with T1DM, modern intensive therapy using pumps and CGM is not cost-effective (>$250,000/QALY-gained) but would be more cost-effective if associated with less hypoglycemia, better glycemic control, fewer complications, or improved health-related quality-of-life.
Use of the least expensive intensive therapy needed to safely achieve treatment goals for patients with T1DM represents a good value for money.

Accuracy of a Fourth-Generation Continuous Glucose Monitoring System in Children and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30063162/),"
This study evaluated the safety and performance of the Guardian™ continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
Subjects 2-18 years of age (mean ± standard deviation [SD] 13.1 ± 3.9 years) with T1D and duration of diagnosis ≥1 year were enrolled at 11 sites in the United States and wore two Guardian Sensor 3 sensors in the abdomen and/or buttock. Sensors were connected to a transmitter paired with either a Guardian Connect system (i.e., mobile device with software application allowing display of sensor glucose [SG] values) or a Guardian Link 3 transmitter used as a Glucose Sensor Recorder (GSR). There were 145 participants who underwent a 6-h in-clinic frequent sample testing (FST) on day 1 (n = 54), day 3 (n = 48), or day 7 (n = 43) postsensor insertion. During FST, SG values were compared with a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) plasma reference every 5-15 min (n = 124, 7-18 years of age; n = 2, 2-6 years of age), or to a self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) reference every 5-30 min (n = 19, 2-6 years of age).
The overall mean absolute relative difference (ARD ± SD) between SG and reference values (YSI or SMBG) when calibrating approximately every 12 h, was 10.9% ± 10.7% (3102 paired points) for sensors communicating with the Guardian Connect system and 11.1% ± 10.6% (2624 paired points) for sensors connected to the GSR. The overall percentage of SG values within ±20% of reference values >80 mg/dL or within 20 mg/dL of reference values ≤80 mg/dL was 87.8% for the Guardian Connect system and 86.7% for the GSR, respectively. There was one device-related adverse event of contact dermatitis, but no serious device-related adverse events.
The Guardian CGM system demonstrated good accuracy in children and adolescents. These findings support its use in sensor-integrated insulin pump platforms, as well as a standalone technology, for managing diabetes in pediatric populations.

Risk and Relevance of Insulin Pump Therapy in the Aetiology of Ketoacidosis in People with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30049002/),"
The aim of this systematic data analysis was to determine the prevalence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) as well as hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic disorders during insulin pump therapy (CSII) in patients with type 1 diabetes. The main focus was to investigate whether CSII patients have more DKA than the general type 1 diabetes population.
This retrospective study with patients who were treated in our treatment center from 2003 to 2016 includes data from 229 patients (52.4% male, 47.6% female, 37.2Â±16.3 years; DKA: 93, hypoglycemia: 66, hyperglycemia: 70).
Intensified insulin therapy was the most common treatment regimen in the study cohort (73.4%), followed by CSII (24%). However, 32.3% of the patients with DKA were on CSII. This number of DKA cases among the insulin pump users in our study cohort was higher than the prevalence reported in a previously published study by Reichel et al. (2013; p<0.05) and in a customer database (p<0.005). Most common causes of DKA in our study cohort were patient errors (43.3%) or insulin resistance induced by an underlying infection (29.8%). Device malfunction caused 13.5% of all DKA cases with an overwhelming majority on insulin pump treatment (93%). Overall, patient errors caused more DKA cases than device malfunctions.
Our findings suggest that despite development of more sophisticated insulin pump devices, DKA is still more frequent with CSII than with other kinds of insulin treatment.

Optimizing a Hybrid Closed Loop System in Type 1 Diabetes: A Case Report.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30030688/),"
We present the optimization of a hybrid closed-loop (HCL) insulin pump system in a type 1 diabetes (T1D) patient in the first 3 months of using the Minimed 670G. An 11-year-old female with 7 years of T1D history started using the Minimed 670G HCL system at our center. The patient had been using the Medtronic Veo insulin pump without a sensor for almost 4 years with HbA1c levels between 7.8% and 10.2%. We introduced the Minimed 670G to improve overall glucose control, improve quality of life and lessen the diabetes burden. Insulin pump characteristics of the Minimed Veo pump were used as the initial setting in the HCL system. The optimization of the Minimed 670G in the next 3 months led to the following changes: an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio (ICHR) from 1 to 10 g in the morning period (6 a.m. to 12 a.m.) and 15-12 g for the rest of the day (12 p.m. to 6 a.m.); an active insulin time from 4 to 3 h and insulin sensitivity factor (ISF) from 120 to 90 mg/dl with no change in target range. The HbA1c level decreased by - 1.3%, and the time in range significantly increased to 77% with SG values of 139 ± 60 mg/dl, sensor wear of 82% and an auto mode period of 84% per week. Health providers should consider immediate adjustment of the bolus wizard settings such as the ICHR, ISF and active insulin time. The HCL system can improve overall glucose control with increased time in the range of sensor glucose values and reduction of HbA1c levels.

Establishing Methods to Determine Clinically Relevant Bolus and Basal Rate Delivery Accuracy of Insulin Pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30003823/),"
Adequate testing of delivery accuracy of insulin pumps is under discussion. Especially for patch pumps, test settings are challenging. In addition, evaluation and presentation of accuracy results in a way that is reasonable and useful for clinicians, not only for technicians, is important.
Test setups based on IEC 60601-2-24 were used and, in addition, different setups for patch pumps were compared to identify an adequate alternative for pumps without external infusion set. These setups are applicable for both bolus and basal rate accuracy testing. In addition, evaluation procedures considering clinical relevance were compiled.
A setup for patch pumps that provides reliable results could be realized. Evaluation of basal rate accuracy data should also consider the actual clinical use of insulin pumps and thus, deviating from IEC 60601-2-24, compose the whole measurement period without excluding the first 24 hours. In addition to the presentation using trumpet curves, accuracy of 1-hour windows should be evaluated and displayed.
This article proposes an approach on how to test, evaluate, and present bolus and basal rate accuracy of insulin pumps from a clinical perspective.

All 35 subjects completed the study as planned and used the system for a total of 1013 days. After home use, 74% of the subjects were very satisfied or quite satisfied with the new pump. The subjects confirmed that the system is easy to use, especially considering general handling, bolus delivery and basal rate settings, infusion set, and cartridge change. Potential for improvements was seen in the touchscreen, warnings and alarms, the blind bolus function, the availability of a bolus calculator (was not available at time of study), and the cartridge size as rated by the study participants. Safety analysis did not raise any concerns for the use of this system.
The majority of the users testing the system were satisfied with the novel insulin pump system and the system was safe for use under everyday conditions by this study population.

Diabetes Technology Update: Use of Insulin Pumps and Continuous Glucose Monitoring in the Hospital.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29936424/),"
The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems has gained wide acceptance in diabetes care. These devices have been demonstrated to be clinically valuable, improving glycemic control and reducing risks of hypoglycemia in ambulatory patients with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Approximately 30-40% of patients with type 1 diabetes and an increasing number of insulin-requiring patients with type 2 diabetes are using pump and sensor technology. As the popularity of these devices increases, it becomes very likely that hospital health care providers will face the need to manage the inpatient care of patients under insulin pump therapy and CGM. The American Diabetes Association advocates allowing patients who are physically and mentally able to continue to use their pumps when hospitalized. Health care institutions must have clear policies and procedures to allow the patient to continue to receive CSII treatment to maximize safety and to comply with existing regulations related to self-management of medication. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine whether CSII therapy and CGM systems in the hospital are associated with improved clinical outcomes compared with intermittent monitoring and conventional insulin treatment or with a favorable cost-benefit ratio.

Clinical value of Flash glucose monitoring in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29907546/),"
To analyze the clinical impact of the Flash glucose monitoring system in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
A 24-week retrospective cohort study in CSII-treated T1DM patients exposed (1:1) to the Flash glucose monitoring system vs. self-monitoring of capillary blood glucose (SMBG). The primary outcome was the difference in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels between both groups at the end of the study.
Thirty-six patients with a mean age of 38.2 years (range 22-55) and a mean T1DM duration of 20.9±7.8 years, treated with CSII for 7.1±5.4 years, were enrolled into the study. At the end of the study, mean HbA1c levels improved in patients in the Flash group (7.1±0.7 vs. 7.8±1.0, p=0.04). Only the Flash group showed a significant decrease in HbA1c levels of -0.4% (95% CI, -0.6, -0.2; p=0.004) during follow-up. Flash patients captured 93.9% of data through 17.8±9.9 scans daily. In fact, the Flash cohort showed a three-fold increase in daily self-monitoring of glucose, while daily frequency of SMBG decreased during the study (-1.8 tests/24h (95% CI -3, -0.7; p=0.01). No safety issues related to Flash use were recorded.
The Flash glucose monitoring system is a novel approach to improve blood glucose control in CSII-treated T1DM patients. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the effectiveness of this system in CSII-treated T1DM patients.

Dental caries and bacterial load in saliva and dental biofilm of type 1 diabetics on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29898180/),"
Since most of the studies evaluates diabetics on multiple daily injections therapy and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion may help gain better metabolic control and prevent complications, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries, the unstimulated salivary flow rate and the total bacteria load, Streptococcus spp. levels and Lactobacillus spp. levels in saliva and supragingival dental biofilm of type 1 diabetics on insulin pump.
Sixty patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump and 60 nondiabetic individuals were included. The dental caries evaluation was performed using ICDAS and the oral hygiene was assessed according to Greene and Vermillion Simplified Oral Hygiene Index. Unstimulated saliva and supragingival dental biofilm were collected. Total bacteria, Streptococcus spp. and Lactobacillus spp. was quantified by qPCR.
Patients with type 1 diabetes had a higher prevalence of dental caries and filled and missing teeth when compared with the control group. These patients were associated with more risk factors for the development of dental caries, namely a lower unstimulated salivary flow rate and a higher bacterial load in saliva and dental biofilm.
Some risk factors related to dental caries were associated with type 1 diabetics. An early diagnosis combined with the evaluation of the risk profile of the diabetic patient is imperative, allowing the dental caries to be analyzed through a perspective of prevention and the patient to be integrated into an individualized oral health program.

Insulin pump breakdown and infusion set failure in Italian children with type 1 diabetes: A 1-year prospective observational study with suggestions to minimize clinical impact.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29893044/),"
To evaluate the incidence of insulin pump and infusion set failures in a cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes during a 1-year follow-up.
Insulin pump breakdown and infusion set failures were prospectively registered in a cohort of 1046 children and adolescents from 25 tertiary pediatric diabetes centres (50% male, mean age 12.2 ± 4.1 years), with type 1 diabetes from the age of 6.7 ± 3.6 years, and using an insulin pump from the age of 3.3 ± 2.2 years.
An average rate of 4.5 failures/person-year was registered; the incidences (events per person-year) for each failure were 8.4 for hyperglycaemia episodes solved with infusion set change, 7 for bubbles, 2.8 for kinking, 2.4 for bleeding, 2 for set dislodge, 2 for pump blockage, 1.9 for tunnelling, 1.8 for lipohypertrophy, and 0.3 for infection. At multivariate analysis significant association between HbA1c and lipohypertrophy (P < 0.0028) was shown. Analysis by age group (<6, 6-11, >11 years) showed a higher frequency of bubbles, hyperglycaemia episodes and lipohypertrophy in preschoolers; tunnelling and pump blockage were more frequent in adolescents. Aspart was associated with a lower risk of bubbles and hyperglycaemia whereas glulisine was associated with a higher risk of lipohypertrophy and pump blockage. The usage of oblique cannula was associated with a low risk of all failures except infections.
This prospective 1-year study on a large cohort of Italian children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy showed a low total failure rate, highlighting the importance of continuous education to reduce failures. Lipohypertrophy was the only issue associated with a worsening of metabolic control.

Contribution of basal and postprandial hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes patients treated by an intensified insulin regimen: Impact of pump therapy in the OPT2mise trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29862649/),"
The relative contribution of basal hyperglycaemia (BHG) and postprandial hyperglycaemia (PPHG) in type 2 diabetes patients treated with multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin is poorly documented. In this study, the BHG and PPHG of patients from the OPT2mise study who were initially treated with MDI were assessed before randomization and again after 6 months of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
Blinded continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data were collected in 259 MDI patients after completion of an 8-week run-in period. The hyperglycaemic area under the curve (AUC) during the 24-hour basal period (AUC-B) and the postprandial period (AUC-P) were compared with analysis of variance based on contribution to total hyperglycaemia in HbA1c groups (Group 1, <8%; Group 2, 8%-8.4%; Group 3, 8.5%-8.9%; Group 4, 9%-9.4%; Group 5, ≥9.5%). Changes in AUC-B and AUC-P were assessed after 6 months of pump therapy in 131 randomized participants with available CGM recordings.
In patients undergoing MDI therapy, AUC-B was 21.6% to 54.8% lower in Group 4 to 1 (P = .0138 and P = .0002, respectively) in comparison to Group 5. In contrast, AUC-P did not differ among HbA1c groups (P = .1009). HbA1c correlated with AUC-B, but not with AUC-P. After switching to CSII, AUC-B and AUC-P decreased by 21% and 17%, respectively. When comparing responders with non-responders to CSII therapy, no between-group differences were observed in AUC-B and AUC-P.
Basal hyperglycaemia is the major determinant of overall exposure to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes with MDI failure.

A qualitative study exploring patients' experiences regarding insulin pump use.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29844719/),"
Diabetes is a threat to peoples' lives around the world, particularly in the Middle East. Medicine misuse and poor glycaemic control are prevalent among patients with type 2 diabetes, especially insulin-dependent patients (Alsairafi et al., 2016). With advances in medical technology, insulin pumps became a treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes and those with insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes. However, use of these devices is still lacking in Kuwait, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes. Information on how patients manage these devices and their efficacy and safety from the perspectives of patients is also lacking (Alsaleh et al., 2016).
To examine the views and experiences of adults with type 2 diabetes regarding the use of insulin pumps compared to their previous insulin delivery methods, in terms of glycaemic control, quality of life, preference, convenience and adherence to doses.
The main five secondary-care hospitals in Kuwait: Mobarak Al-Kabeer, Al Amiri, Al Adan, Al Farwaniya and Al Jahra.
All adults with type 2 diabetes who used an insulin pump were invited to participate. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Data analysis was performed using MAXQDA-11.
A total of eight patients were interviewed. Interviews with patients revealed that using an insulin pump improved patients' glycaemic control and quality of life as a consequence of improved satisfaction and adherence to doses.
From the perspective of adults with type 2 diabetes, there are lots of benefits of using insulin pumps over other insulin delivery methods, mainly seen by the improvement of quality of life and patients' adherence to doses. Policy-makers and healthcare professionals (HCPs) must be aware of such benefits and should support the wider implementation of this technology in the country by including patients with type 2 diabetes. Results of this study will help to inform healthcare provision and guideline modifications and to provide guidance for new patients using this therapy.

A critical review and analysis of ethical issues associated with the artificial pancreas.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29753624/),"
The artificial pancreas combines a hormone infusion pump with a continuous glucose monitoring device, supported by a dosing algorithm currently installed on the pump. It allows for dynamic infusions of insulin (and possibly other hormones such as glucagon) tailored to patient needs. For patients with type 1 diabetes the artificial pancreas has been shown to prevent more effectively hypoglycaemic events and hyperglycaemia than insulin pump therapy and has the potential to simplify care. However, the potential ethical issues associated with the upcoming integration of the artificial pancreas into clinical practice have not yet been discussed. Our objective was to identify and articulate ethical issues associated with artificial pancreas use for patients, healthcare professionals, industry and policymakers. We performed a literature review to identify clinical, psychosocial and technical issues raised by the artificial pancreas and subsequently analysed them through a common bioethics framework. We identified five sensitive domains of ethical issues. Patient confidentiality and safety can be jeopardized by the artificial pancreas' vulnerability to security breaches or unauthorized data sharing. Public and private coverage of the artificial pancreas could be cost-effective and warranted. Patient selection criteria need to ensure equitable access and sensitivity to patient-reported outcomes. Patient coaching and support by healthcare professionals or industry representatives could help foster realistic expectations in patients. Finally, the artificial pancreas increases the visibility of diabetes and could generate issues related to personal identity and patient agency. The timely consideration of these issues will optimize the technological development and clinical uptake of the artificial pancreas.

Analyzing the Potential of Advanced Insulin Dosing Strategies in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Results From a Hybrid In Silico Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29681172/),"
The ongoing improvement of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensors and of insulin pumps are paving the way for a fast implementation of artificial pancreas (AP) for type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients. The case for type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients is less obvious since usually some residual beta cell function allows for simpler therapy approaches, and even multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy is not very widespread. However, the number of insulin dependent T2D patients is vastly increasing and therefore a need for understanding chances and challenges of an automated insulin therapy arises. Based on this background, this article analyzes conditions under which the use of more advanced therapeutic approaches, particularly AP, could bring a substantial improvement and should be considered as a viable therapy option.
Data of 14 insulin-treated T2D patients on MDI wearing a CGM device and deviation analysis methods were used to estimate the expected improvements in the clinical outcome by using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with advanced carbohydrate counting, a full AP or intermediate approaches, either CGM measurements with MDI therapy or SMBG with insulin pump. HbA1C and time in range (70-140 mg/dl, 70-180 mg/dl, respectively) were used as a performance measure. Outcome measures beyond glycemic control (eg, compliance, patient acceptance) have not been analyzed in this study.
AP has the potential to improve the condition of many poorly controlled insulin-treated T2D patients. However, as the interpatient variability is much higher than in T1D, a prescreening is recommended to select suitable patients.
Clinical criteria need to be developed for inclusion/exclusion of T2D patients for AP related therapies.

Open-loop glucose control: Automatic IOB-based super-bolus feature for commercial insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29650309/),"
Although there has been significant progress towards closed-loop type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treatments, most diabetic patients still treat this metabolic disorder in an open-loop manner, based on insulin pump therapy (basal and bolus insulin infusion). This paper presents a method for automatic insulin bolus shaping based on insulin-on-board (IOB) as an alternative to conventional bolus dosing.
The methodology presented allows the pump to generate the so-called super-bolus (SB) employing a two-compartment IOB dynamic model. The extra amount of insulin to boost the bolus and the basal cutoff time are computed using the duration of insulin action (DIA). In this way, the pump automatically re-establishes basal insulin when IOB reaches its basal level. Thus, detrimental transients caused by manual or a-priori computations are avoided.
The potential of this method is illustrated via in-silico trials over a 30 patients cohort in single meal and single day scenarios. In the first ones, improvements were found (standard treatment vs. automatic SB) both in percentage time in euglycemia (75g meal: 81.9 ± 15.59 vs. 89.51 ± 11.95, ρ ≃ 0; 100g meal: 75.12 ± 18.23 vs. 85.46 ± 14.96, ρ ≃ 0) and time in hypoglecymia (75g meal: 5.92 ± 14.48 vs. 0.97 ± 4.15, ρ=0.008; 100g meal: 9.5 ± 17.02 vs. 1.85 ± 7.05, ρ=0.014). In a single day scenario, considering intra-patient variability, the time in hypoglycemia was reduced (9.57 ± 14.48 vs. 4.21 ± 6.18, ρ=0.028) and improved the time in euglycemia (79.46 ± 17.46 vs. 86.29 ± 11.73, ρ=0.007).
The automatic IOB-based SB has the potential of a better performance in comparison with the standard treatment, particularly for high glycemic index meals with high carbohydrate content. Both glucose excursion and time spent in hypoglycemia were reduced.

Continuous Monitoring of Glucose for Type 1 Diabetes: A Health Technology Assessment.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29541282/),"
Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin. People with type 1 diabetes must manage their blood glucose levels by monitoring the amount of glucose in their blood and administering appropriate amounts of insulin via injection or an insulin pump. Continuous glucose monitoring may be beneficial compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose using a blood glucose meter. It provides insight into a person's blood glucose levels on a continuous basis, and can identify whether blood glucose levels are trending up or down.
We conducted a health technology assessment, which included an evaluation of clinical benefit, value for money, and patient preferences related to continuous glucose monitoring. We compared continuous glucose monitoring with self-monitoring of blood glucose using a finger-prick and a blood glucose meter. We performed a systematic literature search for studies published since January 1, 2010. We created a Markov model projecting the lifetime horizon of adults with type 1 diabetes, and performed a budget impact analysis from the perspective of the health care payer. We also conducted interviews and focus group discussions with people who self-manage their type 1 diabetes or support the management of a child with type 1 diabetes.
Twenty studies were included in the clinical evidence review. Compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose, continuous glucose monitoring improved the percentage of time patients spent in the target glycemic range by 9.6% (95% confidence interval 8.0-11.2) to 10.0% (95% confidence interval 6.75-13.25) and decreased the number of severe hypoglycemic events.Continuous glucose monitoring was associated with higher costs and small increases in health benefits (quality-adjusted life-years). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) ranged from $592,206 to $1,108,812 per quality-adjusted life-year gained in analyses comparing four continuous glucose monitoring interventions to usual care. However, the uncertainty around the ICERs was large. The net budget impact of publicly funding continuous glucose monitoring assuming a 20% annual increase in adoption of continuous glucose monitoring would range from $8.5 million in year 1 to $16.2 million in year 5.Patient engagement surrounding the topic of continuous glucose monitoring was robust. Patients perceived that these devices provided important social, emotional, and medical and safety benefits in managing type 1 diabetes, especially in children.
Continuous glucose monitoring was more effective than self-monitoring of blood glucose in managing type 1 diabetes for some outcomes, such as time spent in the target glucose range and time spent outside the target glucose range (moderate certainty in this evidence). We were less certain that continuous glucose monitoring would reduce the number of severe hypoglycemic events. Compared with self-monitoring of blood glucose, the costs of continuous glucose monitoring were higher, with only small increases in health benefits. Publicly funding continuous glucose monitoring for the type 1 diabetes population in Ontario would result in additional costs to the health system over the next 5 years. Adult patients and parents of children with type 1 diabetes reported very positive experiences with continuous glucose monitoring. The high ongoing cost of continuous glucose monitoring devices was seen as the greatest barrier to their widespread use.

Long-term study of tubeless insulin pump therapy compared to multiple daily injections in youth with type 1 diabetes: Data from the German/Austrian DPV registry.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29446511/),"
To examine glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who switched from multiple daily injections (MDI) to a tubeless insulin pump (Omnipod Insulin Management System, Insulet Corporation, Billerica, Massachusetts) compared to patients who continued MDI therapy over a 3-year time period.
This retrospective analysis of the German/Austrian Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation registry included data from 263 centers and 2529 patients <20 years (n = 660 tubeless insulin pump; n = 1869 MDI) who initiated treatment on a tubeless insulin pump as of January 1, 2013 and had 1 year of data preswitch from MDI and 3 years of data postswitch to a tubeless pump. Outcomes included the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin dose, and body mass index (BMI) SD score (SDS).
Youth with T1D who switched from MDI therapy to a tubeless insulin pump showed better glycemic control at 1 year compared to patients who continued MDI treatment, adjusted mean ± SE: 7.5% ± 0.03% (58 mmol/mol) vs 7.7% ± 0.02% (61 mmol/mol); P < .001, with no between-group difference at 2 and 3 years. Total daily insulin dose was lower (P < .001) in the tubeless insulin pump group, 0.80 ± 0.01, 0.81 ± 0.01, and 0.85 ± 0.01 U/kg, vs the MDI group, 0.89 ± 0.01, 0.94 ± 0.01, and 0.97 ± 0.01 U/kg, at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively (all P < .001). BMI SDS increased in both groups and was not different over time.
Treatment with a tubeless insulin pump in youth with T1D was associated with improvements in glycemic control compared to MDI after 1 year and appears to be an effective alternative to MDI.

Safety of Insulin Lispro and a Biosimilar Insulin Lispro When Administered Through an Insulin Pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29359575/),"
SAR342434 (U100; SAR-Lis; insulin lispro) is a biosimilar/follow-on to insulin lispro (U100; Ly-Lis). Similar pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics between the two products has been demonstrated in a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study. The current study evaluated the safety of SAR-Lis and Ly-Lis when administered by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII; insulin pumps).
This was a randomized, open-label, 2 × 4-week, two-arm crossover study in 27 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (NCT02603510). The main outcome was the incidence of infusion set occlusions (ISOs), defined as failure to correct hyperglycemia (plasma glucose ≥≥ 300 mg/dl) by 50 mg/dl within 60 minutes by insulin bolus via the pump. Secondary outcomes included intervals between infusion set changes, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) including infusion site, hypersensitivity reactions and hypoglycemic events, and safety.
The number of patients reporting at least one ISO was small: 6/25 patients on SAR-Lis reported 14 ISOs and 4/27 on Ly-Lis reported nine ISOs. The estimated difference in ISO risk for SAR-Lis versus Ly-Lis was 7.9% (95% CI, -1.90 to 17.73). Mean interval between infusion set changes for any reason was similar with SAR-Lis (3.09 days) and Ly-Lis (2.95 days). The event rate (events/patient-month) of any hypoglycemia was similar with SAR-Lis (7.15) and Ly-Lis (7.98), as was the percentage of patients who experienced any TEAE (12.0% and 14.8%).
Both SAR-Lis and Ly-Lis were well tolerated by patients using insulin pumps. The results do not suggest a clinically significant difference in the risk of ISO between SAR-Lis and Ly-Lis when used in CSII.

The Effects of Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Versus Multiple Insulin Injections on Glucose Variability in Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes: The 2-Year Follow-Up of the Observational METRO Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29303370/),"
Type 1 diabetic patients have high instability of daily glucose levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy, compared with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI), on glucose variability, in young type 1 diabetic patients transitioned to the adult diabetes care.
Patients aged 18-30 years and considered eligible for insulin pump therapy were included in the study. Ninety-eight patients who started CSII therapy and 125 who remained in MDI completed a 2-year follow-up. Glucose variability was assessed with continuous glucose monitoring using blood glucose standard deviation (BGSD), mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), continuous overall net glycemic action (CONGA-2 h), low blood glucose index, high blood glucose index, and average daily risk range.
MAGE and BGSD decreased in both groups, with adjusted differences at 2 years of -0.74 mM (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.22 to -0.26, P = 0.003) and -0.3 (CI -0.52 to -0.1, P = 0.005) favoring the pump-therapy group. No significant differences between groups in the other variability indexes were observed. HbA1c decreased in both groups without significant difference (0.05%, -0.26, 0.35, P = 0.77); fasting glucose, insulin dose, and overall hypoglycemia (daily, nocturnal, and severe) decreased more in patients with CSII, compared with those with MDI.
Among young adults with type 1 diabetes transitioning from the pediatric care, the use of CSII is associated with lower glucose variability, fasting glycemia, and overall hypoglycemic events than MDI during a 2-year period of follow-up.

Insulin Pump and Continuous Glucose Monitor Initiation in Hospitalized Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29293367/),"
Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) are commonly used by patients with diabetes mellitus in the outpatient setting. The efficacy and safety of initiating inpatient insulin pumps and CGM in the nonintensive care unit setting is unknown.
In a prospective pilot study, inpatients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive standard subcutaneous basal-bolus insulin and blinded CGM (group 1, n = 5), insulin pump and blinded CGM (group 2, n = 6), or insulin pump and nonblinded CGM (group 3, n = 5). Feasibility, glycemic control, and patient satisfaction were evaluated among groups.
Group 1 had lower mean capillary glucose levels, 144.5 ± 19.5 mg/dL, compared with groups 2 and 3, 191.5 ± 52.3 and 182.7 ± 59.9 mg/dL (P1 vs. 2+3 = 0.05). CGM detected 19 hypoglycemic episodes (glucose <70 mg/dL) among all treatment groups, compared with 12 episodes detected by capillary testing, although not statistically significant. No significant differences were found for the total daily dose of insulin or percentage of time spent below target glucose range (<90 mg/dL), in target glucose range (90-180 mg/dL), or above target glucose range (>180 mg/dL). On the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire-Change, group 3 reported increased hyperglycemia and decreased hypoglycemia frequency compared with the other two groups, although the differences did not reach statistical significance.
Insulin pump and CGM initiation are feasible during hospitalization, although they are labor intensive. Although insulin pump initiation may not lead to improved glycemic control, there is a trend toward CGM detecting a greater number of hypoglycemic episodes. Larger studies are needed to determine whether use of this technology can lower inpatient morbidity and mortality.

To test whether weight-based treatment is more effective than usual care in people with Type 1 diabetes receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy with regard to both hypoglycaemia and avoiding excessive rebound hyperglycaemia.
Children and adults on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion were enrolled into a study with a crossover design. Each episode of hypoglycaemia (defined as capillary glucose <4.0 mmol/l) was randomly assigned one of two treatment protocols using glucose tablets: either 0.3 g/kg body weight or usual treatment with 15 g (adults) or 10 g (children) for capillary glucose levels 3-3.9 mmol/l or twice these doses for capillary glucose levels <3 mmol/l. All participants received each treatment in random order for up to 10 hypoglycaemic episodes. Glucose levels were re-tested 10 min after treatment, with a repeat dose if still <4 mmol/l.
Of the 37 participants enrolled, 35 (aged 6-68 years) completed the study. Twenty-four participants completed all treatment episodes, while 10 participants had <10 hypoglycaemic episodes and two withdrew without data. The mean glucose difference between weight-based and usual treatment after 10 min was 0.33 mmol/l (95% CI 0.005 to 0.66; P=0.047) in adults and 0.45 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.72; P=0.001) in children. The odds ratios for resolution of hypoglycaemia at 10 min with a single treatment using weight-based compared with usual treatment were 3.12 (95% CI 1.38 to 7.02; P=0.0070) in adults and 2.61 (95% CI 1.19 to 5.74; P=0.017) in children.

The aim was to model the effects of exposure to a low or intermediate frequency electromagnetic field (LIF-EMF), characterized by the electric field induced in the body, in order to evaluate how the type of insulin needle and the way it is injected influences the exposed user of a wearable insulin pump.
Numerical models of exposure scenarios (sources of LIF-EMF, with a dominant magnetic component: 50Hz-1MHz; the insulin needle type; the way it is injected and insulin pump user) were worked out. The influence of the insulin needle on the user's safety (the ratio of the induced electric field in tissues surrounding the needle and tissues of a person without an injection, both exposed identically) were calculated.
The effects of LIF-EMF exposure in insulin pump users were found to be up to approximately 7-times higher, varying with statistically significance (p < .05) with the material of the needle, the way it is injected and the polarization of the affecting magnetic field.
When steel insulin needles is used, the assessment of user's EMF exposure should be carried out using magnetic field limits at least 5-times lower than given in general international requirements.

An Economic Evaluation of Continuous Glucose Monitoring for People with Type 1 Diabetes and Impaired Awareness of Hypoglycaemia within North West London Clinical Commissioning Groups in England.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29632613/),"
To assess the economic impact of providing real time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for people with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia (IAH) within North West (NW) London clinical commissioning groups (CCGs).
The eligible population for CGM and inputs for the economic budget impact model developed were derived from published data. The model includes cost of CGM; cost savings associated with lower hypoglycaemia related hospital admissions, accidents and emergency visits; self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) strip usage; and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction-related avoided complications and insulin pump use.
The cost of CGM for T1D-IAH (n=3,036) in the first year is £10,770,671 and in the fourth year is £11,329,095. The combined cost off-sets related to reduced hypoglycaemia admissions, SMBG strip usage and complications are £8,116,912 and £8,741,026 in years one and four, respectively. The net budget impact within the NW London CCGs is £2,653,760; £2,588,068 in years one and four respectively.
Introduction of CGM for T1D-IAH patients will have a minimal budget impact on NW London CCGs, driven by cost of CGM and offsets from lower hypoglycaemia-related costs, reduced SMBG strip usage, avoided HbA1c-related complications and lower insulin pump use.

Metabolic control and complications in Italian people with diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29428572/),"
The objective of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the degree of glycaemic control and the frequency of diabetic complications in Italian people with diabetes who were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
Questionnaires investigating the organisation of diabetes care centres, individuals' clinical and metabolic features and pump technology and its management were sent to adult and paediatric diabetes centres that use CSII for treatment in Italy. Information on standard clinical variables, demographic data and acute and chronic diabetic complications was derived from local clinical management systems. The sample consisted of 6623 people with diabetes, which was obtained from 93 centres. Of them, 98.8% had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 57.2% were female, 64% used a conventional insulin pump and 36% used a sensor-augmented insulin pump. The median glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level was 60 mmol/mol (7.6%). The HbA1c target (i.e. <58 mmol/mol for age <18 years and <53 mmol/mol for age >18 years) was achieved in 43.4% of paediatric and 23% of adult participants. Factors such as advanced pump functions, higher rate of sensor use, pregnancy in the year before the study and longer duration of diabetes were associated with lower HbA1c levels. The most common chronic complications occurring in diabetes were retinopathy, microalbuminuria and hypertension. In the year before the study, 5% of participants reported ≥1 episode of severe hypoglycaemic (SH) episodes (SH) and 2.6% reported ≥1 episode of ketoacidosis.
Advanced personal skills and use of sensor-based pump are associated with better metabolic control outcomes in Italian people with diabetes who were treated with CSII. The reduction in SH episodes confirms the positive effect of CSII on hypoglycaemia.

Effect of Optimization of Glycaemic Control on Mannan-Binding Lectin in Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29318157/),"
Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) concentration in plasma is increased in subjects with type 1 diabetes and associated with increased mortality and risk of diabetic nephropathy. Recent findings show that pancreas transplantation reduces MBL concentration. Whether the increased MBL concentration is reversed by improved glycaemic control remains unknown. We investigated the effects of improved glycaemic control on MBL concentration in patients with type 1 diabetes.
We measured MBL, fructosamine, and HbA1cat baseline and after 6 weeks in 52 type 1 diabetic patients following the change from conventional insulin therapy to insulin pump therapy.
After initiation of insulin pump therapy, the total daily insulin dose was significantly reduced (from 51 ± 18 IE/day to 39 ± 13 IE/day, P < 0.0001). There was a significant decrease in HbA1c from 8.6% to 7.7% (from 70 mmol/mol to 61 mmol/mol, P < 0.0001) and in fructosamine levels (from 356 μmol/L to 311 μmol/L, P < 0.0001). MBL levels decreased by 10% from 2165 μg/L (IQR 919-3389 μg/L) at baseline to 1928 μ/L (IQR 811-2758 μg/L) at follow-up (P = 0.005), but MBL change was not significantly correlated with changes in insulin dose, HbA1c, or fructosamine.
MBL concentration decreased following the initiation of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes and did not correlate with changes in glycaemic control.

Occlusion Detection Time in Insulin Pumps at Two Different Basal Rates.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29284290/),"
The detection of insulin infusion set (IIS) occlusions is an important feature of insulin pumps with regard to patient safety. However, there are no requirements for a time limit until an alarm has to be triggered after an occlusion occurred. The standard IEC 60601-2-24 is applicable for insulin pumps and describes test settings and procedures to determine occlusion detection time (ODT).
In this study, ODT of six different insulin pump models with different IIS (in total 10 different insulin pump systems) was tested for two basal rates (1.0 U/h and 0.1 U/h).
Differences were seen between the tested pump systems. At a basal rate of 1.0 U/h all insulin pump systems showed an acceptable ODT of less than 5 hours. However, at a basal rate of 0.1 U/h, as often used in children, the median ODT ranged from approximately 4 hours to more than 40 hours. With the lower basal rate, median ODT was longer than 6-8 hours for 9 of the 10 systems.
Insulin pump users should not blindly rely on occlusion alarms but perform regular glucose monitoring and manufacturers should develop mechanisms that allow an earlier detection at low basal rates.

Depressive Symptoms at Critical Times in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes: Following Type 1 Diabetes Diagnosis and Insulin Pump Initiation.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29212599/),"
Depressive symptoms occur at various times during the life cycle in persons with type 1 diabetes. We investigated depressive symptoms prospectively in youth with new-onset type 1 diabetes and in those beginning pump therapy.
Youth with type 1 diabetes (N = 96), ages 10-17 years, completed the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) at baseline and at 1, 6, and 12 months after diabetes onset or pump start; scores ≥13 indicated clinical elevation. The change in depressive symptoms and the association between CDI score and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level were assessed over 1 year.
The new-onset group (n = 54) had an HbA1c level of 11.4% ± 2.5%. The pump group (n = 42) had a diabetes duration of 4.1 ± 3.4 years and an HbA1c level of 8.3% ± 1.3%. The baseline median CDI was 5.0 in both groups and remained low over time (ranging from 2.0 to 3.5). Most youth (new onset 72%, pump 81%) scored <13 at all times. Those with a CDI score of ≥13 in month 1 had 9-fold (95% confidence interval: 3-28) and 11-fold (95% confidence interval: 3-38) higher risks of CDI score of ≥13 at 6 and 12 months, respectively, than those with a CDI score of <13. New-onset youth with a CDI score of ≥13 in month 1 had a higher HbA1c level at 6 months (8.3% ± 1.7%) than new-onset youth with a CDI score of <13 (7.2% ± 1.6%, p = .04).
CDI scores over 1 year were similar in the new-onset and pump groups. Youth with elevated CDI in the first month after diagnosis or pump start were significantly more likely to have a CDI score of ≥13 at 6 or 12 months, supporting recommendations to screen for depressive symptoms because of persistence over time. Those with new-onset diabetes and depressive symptoms in the first month had higher HbA1c at 6 months; confirmatory research is needed.

Protein and fat meal content increase insulin requirement in children with type 1 diabetes - Role of duration of diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29204367/),"
Hyperglycaemia remains a challenge in type 1 diabetes since current regimes used to determine meal insulin requirements prove to be ineffective. This is particularly problematic for meals containing high amounts of protein and fat. We aimed to determine the post-prandial glycaemic response and total insulin need for mixed meals, using sensor-augmented insulin pumps in children with type 1 diabetes.
Twenty-two children with type 1 diabetes, aged 4-17 years on insulin pump therapy completed this home-based, cross-over, randomised controlled trial. Two meals with identical carbohydrate content - one with low fat and protein (LFLP) and one with high fat and protein (HFHP) contents - were consumed using normal insulin boluses. Blood glucose monitoring was done for 10 h post-meal, with correction bolus insulin given two-hourly if required.
The HFHP meal required significantly more total insulin (3.48 vs. 2.7 units) as a result of increased post-meal correction insulin requirement (1.2 vs. 0.15 units) spread over a longer duration (6 vs. 3 h). The HFHP meals significantly increased the time spent above target glucose level. Duration of diabetes and total daily insulin use significantly influenced the post-prandial blood glucose response to the two meals.
When consuming carbohydrate-based mixed meals, children with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy, required significantly more insulin over a longer period of time than the insulin requirement calculated using current regimes. This additional amount required is influenced by the duration of diabetes and total daily insulin use.

Diabetes Care Disparities in Long-standing Type 1 Diabetes in Canada and the U.S.: A Cross-sectional Comparison.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29118059/),"
To assess national differences in diabetes care and quality of life (QOL) between individuals with long-standing type 1 diabetes (≥50 years) in Canada and the U.S.
Cross-sectional data from identical surveys administered in the Canadian Study of Longevity in Diabetes and the Joslin Medalist Study, collected in 2013-2016 and 2005-2011, respectively, were compared. Laboratory values and ophthalmic examination were completed by clinical care physicians for Canadians and the Joslin Clinic for Americans. Univariate comparisons and multivariable regression for HbA1c, QOL, insulin pump use, and coronary artery disease (CAD) were performed. Nephropathy, CAD, and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) were self-reported; neuropathy was defined by a Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (Questionnaire component) score ≥3, and proliferative retinopathy was documented from ophthalmic examination. QOL was self-reported on an ordinal scale.
Three hundred sixty-one Canadians and 668 Americans had similar ages (mean 65.78 years [SD 8.67] vs. 66.38 years [7.66], P = 0.27) and durations of diabetes (median 53.00 years [interquartile range 51.00, 58.00] vs. 53.00 years [51.00, 57.00], P = 0.51). Canadians had higher HbA1c (mean 7.53% [SD 1.03] [59 mmol/mol] vs. 7.22% [0.98] [55 mmol/mol], P < 0.0001), lower QOL (36.9% vs. 48.7% with ""excellent"" QOL, P = 0.0002), and less CAD (29.7% vs. 41.2%, P = 0.0003) and insulin pump use (43.3% vs. 55.6%, P = 0.0002). Other complication rates were similar. Residual differences for Canadians compared with Americans remained after adjustment for age, sex, CAD, PAD, education, and relevant a priori selected variables: 0.28% higher HbA1c (P = 0.0004); and odds ratios of 0.68 (95% CI 0.51, 0.90), 0.46 (0.31, 0.68), and 0.71 (0.52, 0.96) for higher QOL, CAD, and insulin pump use, respectively.
Although Canadians and Americans have similar rates of complications other than CAD, further research is required to understand why Canadians have higher HbA1c levels, lower QOL, and less insulin pump use.

Safety of the batteries and power units used in insulin pumps: A pilot cross-sectional study by the Association for the Study of Innovative Diabetes Treatment in Japan.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29055098/),"
We investigated the safety of the batteries and power units used in insulin pumps in Japan.
A self-administered questionnaire was sent to the 201 members of the Association for Innovative Diabetes Treatment in Japan.
A total of 56 members responded, and among the 1,499 active devices, 66 had episodes of trouble related to the batteries and power units. The ratio of reported troubles to the number of insulin pumps was significantly higher in insulin pumps with a continuous glucose monitoring sensor compared with insulin pumps without a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (odds ratio 2.82, P < 0.05). The cause and the consequences varied. The brands of the batteries varied; alkaline batteries purchased at drug stores and other shops accounted for 19.7%. Termination of battery life within 72 h of use was reported most frequently (50.0%), suspension of the insulin pump (21.2%) and leakage of the battery fluid (4.5%) followed. A total of 53.2% of the reported insulin pumps needed to be replaced, and 37.1% of them recovered after replacement of the battery.
As trouble related to the batteries and power units of insulin pumps was frequent, practical guidance should be provided to respective patients regarding the use of reliable batteries, and to be well prepared for unexpected insulin pump failure.

Impact of targeted education on managing warning and error signals by children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using the Accu-Chek Combo Insulin Pump System.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29025203/),"
Insulin pumps are widely used in diabetes. They are equipped with safety alarms to alert users. Pump manuals contain alarm codes and how to troubleshoot them. However, these manuals are lengthy and difficult to use, particularly in emergencies. We aim to assess the impact of targeted education on warnings and errors in improving competency to troubleshoot the alarms.
Twenty-one patients, with a median age of 13, were recruited over a 5-month period. Each patient had 2 study visits. The frequencies and types of alarms were recorded, and patients were given a summary sheet that outlined common alarms encountered and troubleshooting tips. In visit 2, the frequencies and types of alarms were compared to those of visit 1. The patients were asked to fill a questionnaire and to rate the education session given in visit 1, their level of competency in decrypting alarm codes, and their promptness in responding to alarms.
Low cartridge (W1), low battery (W2), and bolus cancelled (W8) were the commonest warnings. The most noted errors were occlusion (E4), power interruption (E8), empty battery (E2), set not primed (E11), and cartridge empty (E1). The numbers of warning and error signals markedly decreased after targeted education (P<0.05). The ability in decrypting warning signals significantly improved (P=0.02), and the frequency of response to pump alarms significantly increased (P=0.001).
Certain warnings and errors are more common than others in insulin pumps. Targeted education is useful in improving competency and response of patients in managing pump alarms.

To use systematic methods to explore the psychosocial facilitators and challenges of insulin pump therapy among people with type 1 diabetes.
Insulin pump therapy is now widely accepted in the management of type 1 diabetes. Given the increasing use of insulin pumps, it is timely to review the evidence relating to the psychosocial impacts of this therapy which have not been addressed in previous reviews.
An integrative review of the literature (January 2005-February 2017).
A systematic search of electronic databases: CINAHL, Cochrane, Medline, PsycINFO and Scopus.
Empirical literature reporting psychosocial facilitators and challenges of insulin pump therapy were eligible for inclusion. A constant comparative method was used to guide the review. Quality appraisal was performed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2011.
Thirty-five potential articles identified from titles and abstracts were reviewed. Of these, 13 articles were included in the final review. Psychosocial facilitators of insulin pump therapy included the flexibility and freedom it provided for living with diabetes, enhancing social situations and daily management. In contrast, challenges included the demands of pump therapy, self-consciousness in wearing the pump and fear of hypoglycaemia and pump failure.
Findings can be used by health professionals to inform people embarking on insulin pump therapy and prepare them with regard to expectations of the treatment. Further research is required to explore the role of diabetes health professional in providing psychosocial support to people with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy.

Recent Exposure to Hypoglycemia Increases Glucose Variability Following a Hyper/Hypoglycemic Metabolic Challenge in T1D.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28942668/),"
In type 1 diabetes (T1D), repeated hypoglycemic episodes may reduce hormonal defenses and increase the risk for severe hypoglycemia. In this work, we investigate the effect of a structured hyper/hypoglycemic metabolic challenge on the postintervention glucose variability in T1D subjects studied at home.
Thirty T1D subjects using insulin pump were monitored with blood glucose meters (SMBG) during a 1-month observation period. After 2 weeks of monitoring, participants were admitted at the University of Virginia Clinical Research Unit to undergo an 8-hour metabolic challenge. The intervention was designed to create hyperglycemia shortly followed by hypoglycemia, mimicking a real-life scenario of underbolused meal followed by overcorrection. After the intervention, subjects were monitored for 2 more weeks. Glycemic variability was assessed before and after the challenge using the low blood glucose index (LBGI). Glucagon counterregulation (GCR) response to induced hypoglycemia was also measured. LBGI variation and GCR were linked to prior exposure to hypoglycemia.
Subjects significantly exposed to hypoglycemia in the 2 weeks before the intervention had a significant increase of postchallenge LBGI ( P < .001) and lower GCR response ( P < .05). Recent occurrence of hypoglycemia and number of years not using an insulin pump were identified as significant predictors of postchallenge LBGI ( P < .001).
Glycemic swings, a common result of suboptimal insulin treatment, have a significant impact on future (days) glycemic control in T1D subjects with a recent history of hypoglycemia, as measured in the field. Choice of past insulin therapy may also mediate this effect.

The 2016 Endocrine Society Guidelines have been a great resource for clinicians managing diabetes in this new era of diabetes technology. There is good body of evidence indicating that using diabetes technology systems safely tightens glycemic control while managing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The first-generation diabetes technology systems will evolve as we gain more experience and collaboratively work to improve them with an ultimate goal of keeping people with diabetes complication and burden-free until the cure for diabetes becomes a reality.

Improvement of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion on patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by 3-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28936576/),"
Three-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (3D-STE) was used to evaluate the improvement of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion on the left ventricular (LV) systolic function of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitu (T2DM). We recruited T2DM patients (38 cases, diabetic group) and healthy volunteers (35 cases, control group) to collect LV full volume imaging. TomTec software was used for calculating LV global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), global circumferential strain (LVGCS), peak twist (LVTW), peak apical rotation (LVPAR), ejection fraction (LVEF), and torsion (LVT). All indices were re-tested 2Â weeks later after intensive treatment of insulin pump. LVGLS, LVGCS, LVTW and LVPAR in diabetic group were significantly decreased than control group. LVGLS and LVGCS in pre-treatment diabetic group were significantly increased than post-treatment. LVGLS, LVGCS, LVTW and LVPAR had correlations among control, pre-treatment and post-treatment diabetic groups. There were no significant differences in LVEDV, LVESV, LVEF, LVT and R-R. LV systolic function of patients with T2DM complicated with microangiopathy was improved after treatment of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. In addition, therapeutic effect could be accurately evaluated by 3D-STE which had vital clinical application.

Insulin pumps are used by many patients with diabetes to manage their diabetes therapy. Adequate handling of the systems is important to avoid errors. In this study, one aspect of device handling-the number of steps required to operate the system-was evaluated for different insulin pump systems. Specific tasks that are usually performed by insulin pump users were simulated and all necessary actions were documented. Differences between the required numbers of steps strongly depended on the specific task. So did the level of guidance for these tasks provided by the systems. Results of this study provide an overview of this particular aspect of insulin pump handling rather than a general advice.

Treatment of type 1 diabetes has been intensified aiming at normalizing blood glucose, which may increase the risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH). We aimed to compare the incidence of SH events in the four Nordic countries Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden, and to assess the influence of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and treatment modalities on the frequency of SH; particularly, to explore if a HbA1c target ≤6.7% (50 mmol/mol) is feasible.
Data on children below 15 years with a diabetes duration more than 1 year, registered in the national childhood diabetes databases in the four Nordic countries from 2008 to 2012, were compiled. Data completeness was more than 95%.
Totally 8806 (48% females) patients with 29 715 person years were included, mean age and diabetes duration were 11 years and 5.1 years, respectively. The overall rate of SH was 6.0 per 100 patient-years, and did not change during the study period. The Swedish population constantly had the lowest SH incidence while it decreased significantly in the Danish population. HbA1c decreased significantly over time (p<0.01), while the number of pump users increased (p<0.01). Stratifying for HbA1c levels showed the lowest risk of SH in patients with HbA1c ≤6.7% (≤50 mmol/mol), but in the statistical models adjusting for possible confounders the difference between the HbA1c groups disappeared. Pump users had the lowest SH risk, also after adjusting for possible confounders.
Risk of SH differs between the Nordic countries with the lowest risk in Sweden. Pump therapy was associated with decreased risk of SH. The low HbA1c group had the same or a lower risk of SH compared with the highest HbA1c groups. A target HbA1c ≤6.7% (≤50 mmol/mol) seems achievable without increasing the risk of SH.

Optimal Use of Diabetes Devices: Clinician Perspectives on Barriers and Adherence to Device Use.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28745093/),"
Insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGM) can improve glycemic control for individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Device uptake rates continue to show room for improvement, and consistent adherence is needed to achieve better outcomes. Diabetes health care providers have important roles to play in promoting device use and adherence.
We surveyed 209 clinicians who treat people with type 1 diabetes to examine perceptions of barriers to device uptake, attitudes toward diabetes technology, and resources needed for clinicians to improve device uptake. We compared findings with our survey of adults with T1D.
Younger clinicians treated more patients using insulin pumps ( r = -.26, P < .001) and CGM ( r = -.14, P = .02), and had more positive attitudes about diabetes technology ( r = -.23, P = .001). The most frequently endorsed modifiable barriers were perceptions that patients dislike having the device on their body (73% pump; 63% CGM), dislike the alarms (61% CGM), and do not understand what to do with device information or features (40% pump; 46% CGM). Clinicians wanted lower cost and better insurance coverage for their patients, and they recommended counseling and education to help address barriers and improve adherence to devices.
Clinicians perceive many barriers to their patients initiating and adhering to diabetes devices. Findings highlight opportunities for intervention to improve clinician-patient communication around device barriers to help address them.

Insulin regimens for newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Australia and New Zealand: A survey of current practice.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28727196/),"
There is no consensus on the optimal insulin treatment for children newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The aims of this study were (i) to describe the insulin regimens used at diagnosis by patient age and geographical region and (ii) to explore differences between and within Australia (AU) and New Zealand (NZ) with regards to other aspects of patient management and education.
An online survey of medical professionals caring for children with T1DM in AU and NZ was undertaken. Questions included clinic demographics, insulin regimen/dosing choices and patient education.
Of 110 clinicians identified, 100 responded (91%). The majority of those in AU (69%, P < 0.0001) favour multiple daily injections (MDI) for all ages. In NZ, for patients < 10 years old, (twice daily (BD)) BD therapy was favoured (75%, P < 0.0001), with MDI dominant for ages ≥ 10 years (82%, P < 0.0001). Insulin pump therapy was never considered at diagnosis in NZ, but 38% of clinicians in AU considered using pumps at diagnosis in patients <2 years, but rarely in patients aged 2 and over (16%). Differences in clinician choices were also seen in relation to starting insulin dose.
This is the first study to examine current clinical practice with regards to children newly diagnosed with T1DM. Practice varies across Australasia by clinician and region. This lack of consensus is likely driven by ongoing debates in the current paediatric diabetes evidence base as well as by differences in clinician/centre preference, variations in resourcing and their interpretations of the influence of various patient factors.

In this multicentre, randomised controlled trial, 75 adults with type 1 diabetes in the CGM group of the DIAMOND trial were randomly assigned via the study website using a computer-generated sequence to continue MDI or switch to CSII, with continuation of CGM, for 28 weeks. The primary outcome was CGM-measured time in the glucose concentration range of 70-180 mg/dL (3·9-10·0 mmol/L). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02282397.
Between April 14, 2015, and May 5, 2016, 37 participants were randomly assigned to the CGM plus CSII group and 38 participants were randomly assigned to the CGM plus MDI group. The study was completed by 36 (97%) of 37 participants in the CGM plus CSII group and 35 (92%) of 38 participants in the CGM plus MDI group. Mean CGM use was 6·7 days per week (SD 0·8) in the CGM plus CSII group and 6·9 days per week (0·3) in the CGM plus MDI group (p=0·86). No participants in the CGM plus CSII group who completed the trial discontinued CSII. Over the follow-up period, mean time in the glucose concentration range of 70-180 mg/dL (3·9-10·0 mmol/L) was 791 min per day (SD 157) in the CGM plus CSII group and 741 min per day (225) in the CGM plus MDI group (adjusted mean treatment group difference: 83 min, 95% CI 17-149; p=0·01). Participants in the CGM plus CSII group had a greater reduction in CGM-measured mean glucose (p=0·005) and hyperglycaemia (on four metrics: p=0·007 for >180 mg/dL [>10·0 mmol/L], p=0·02 for >250 mg/dL [>13·9 mmol/L], p=0·04 for >300 mg/dL [>16·6 mmol/L], and p=0·02 for the area under the curve for 180 mg/dL [10·0 mmol/L]), but also an increase in CGM-measured hypoglycaemia (p=0·0001 for <70 mg/dL [<3·9 mmol/L], p=0·0002 for <60 mg/dL [<3·3 mmol/L], p=0·0009 for <50 mg/dL [<2·8 mmol/L], p=0·0002 for the area over the curve for 70 mg/dL [3·9 mmol/L]). Mean HbA1c change from baseline to 28 weeks was 0·3% (SD 0·9; 3·3 mmol/mol [SD 9·8]) in the CGM plus CSII group and 0·1% (0·4; 1·1 mmol/mol [4·4]) in the CGM plus MDI group (p=0·32). Severe hypoglycaemia occurred in one participant in the CGM plus MDI group, and diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hyperglycaemia occurred in one participant each in the CGM plus CSII group.
Our findings show that glycaemic control measured by time in the glucose range of 70-180 mg/dL (3·9-10·0 mmol/L) is improved by initiation of CSII in adults with type 1 diabetes. However, biochemical hypoglycaemia also was increased in the study, which will be important to consider when incorporating these results into clinical practice.

Assessing the effectiveness of a 3-month day-and-night home closed-loop control combined with pump suspend feature compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy in youths and adults with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes: a randomised parallel study protocol.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28710224/),"
Despite therapeutic advances, many individuals with type 1 diabetes are unable to achieve tight glycaemic target without increasing the risk of hypoglycaemia. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a 3-month day-and-night home closed-loop glucose control combined with a pump suspend feature, compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in youths and adults with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes.
The study adopts an open-label, multi-centre, multi-national (UK and USA), randomised, single-period, parallel design and aims for 84 randomised patients. Participants are youths (6-21 years) or adults (>21 years) with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy and suboptimal glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol) and ≤10% (86 mmol/mol)). Following a 4-week run-in period, eligible participants will be randomised to a 3-month use of automated closed-loop insulin delivery combined with pump suspend feature or to sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy. Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. The primary outcome is the time spent in the target glucose range from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L based on continuous glucose monitoring levels during the 3-month free-living phase. Secondary outcomes include HbA1c at 3 months, mean glucose, time spent below and above target; time with glucose levels <3.5 and <2.8 mmol/L; area under the curve when sensor glucose is <3.5 mmol/L, time with glucose levels >16.7 mmol/L, glucose variability; total, basal and bolus insulin dose and change in body weight. Participants' and their families' perception in terms of lifestyle change, daily diabetes management and fear of hypoglycaemia will be evaluated.
Ethics/institutional review board approval has been obtained. Before screening, all participants/guardians will be provided with oral and written information about the trial. The study will be disseminated by peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.

Accuracy of a Fourth-Generation Subcutaneous Continuous Glucose Sensor.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28700272/),"
This study evaluated the accuracy and performance of a fourth-generation subcutaneous glucose sensor (Guardian™ Sensor 3) in the abdomen and arm.
Eighty-eight subjects (14-75 years of age, mean ± standard deviation [SD] of 42.0 ± 19.1 years) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes participated in the study. Subjects wore two sensors in the abdomen that were paired with either a MiniMed™ 640G insulin pump, or an iPhone® or iPod® touch® running a glucose monitoring mobile application (Guardian Connect system) and a third sensor in the arm, which was connected to a glucose sensor recorder (GSR). Subjects were also asked to undergo in-clinic visits of 12-14 h on study days 1, 3, and 7 for frequent blood glucose sample testing using a Yellow Springs Instrument (YSI) reference.
The overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD ± SD) between abdomen sensor glucose (SG) and YSI reference values was 9.6% ± 9.0% and 9.4% ± 9.8% for the MiniMed 640G insulin pump and Guardian Connect system, respectively; and 8.7% ± 8.0% between arm SG and YSI reference values. The percentage of SG values within 20% agreement of the YSI reference value (for YSI >80 mg/dL) was 90.7% with the MiniMed 640G insulin pump, 91.8% with the Guardian Connect system, and 93.1% for GSR-connected arm sensors. Mean functional sensor life, when calibrating 3-4 times/day, was 145.9 ± 39.3 h for sensors paired with the MiniMed 640G insulin pump, 146.1 ± 41.6 h for sensors paired with the Guardian Connect system, and 147.6 ± 40.4 h for sensors connected to the GSR. Responses to survey questions regarding sensor comfort and ease of use were favorable.
The Guardian Sensor 3 glucose sensor, whether located in abdomen or the arm, provided accurate glucose readings when compared with the YSI reference and demonstrated functional life commensurate with the intended 7-day use. ClinicalTrials.gov : NCT02246582.

Comparison of different insulin pump makes under routine care conditions in adults with Type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28636773/),"
To compare long-term HbA1c changes associated with different insulin pumps during routine care in a large cohort of adults with Type 1 diabetes representative of other clinic populations.
Observational, retrospective study of 508 individuals starting pump therapy between 1999 and 2014 (mean age, 40 years; 55% women; diabetes duration, 20 years; 94% Type 1 diabetes; median follow-up, 3.7 years). Mixed linear models compared covariate-adjusted HbA1c changes associated with different pump makes.
The pumps compared were: 50% Medtronic, 24% Omnipod, 14% Roche and 12% Animas. Overall HbA1c levels improved and improvements were maintained during a follow-up extending to 10 years (HbA1c : pre-continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (pre-CSII) vs. 12 months post CSII, 71 (61, 82) vs. 66 (56, 74) mmol/mol; 8.7 (7.7, 9.6) vs. 8.2 (7.3, 8.9)%; P < 0.0001). The percentage of individuals with HbA1c ≥ 64 mmol/mol (8.0%) reduced from a pre-CSII level of 68% to 55%. After adjusting for baseline confounders, there were no between-pump differences in HbA1c lowering (P = 0.44), including a comparison of patch pumps with traditional catheter pumps (P = 0.63). There were no significant (P < 0.05) between-pump differences in HbA1c lowering in pre-specified subgroups stratified by pre-pump HbA1c , age or diabetes duration. HbA1c lowering was positively related to baseline HbA1c (P < 0.001) and diabetes duration (P = 0.017), and negatively related to the number of years of CSII use (P = 0.024).
Under routine care conditions, there were no covariate-adjusted differences in HbA1c lowering when comparing different pump makes, including a comparison of patch pumps vs. traditional catheter pumps. Therefore, the choice of CSII make should not be influenced by the desired degree of HbA1c lowering.

Level of Internet use among Greek adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28598798/),"
Background Compulsive Internet use has emerged as a contemporary addictive behavior. Our aim was to investigate the reasons for Greek adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and their families to use the Internet and additionally to investigate the level of Internet use and its associations to demographic, socio-economic parameters and glycemic control. Methods Patients with T1DM, aged >12 years and their parents were recruited during their regular visits to the Pediatric Diabetes Clinic. A similar group of healthy children, age- and sex-matched served as a control group. All participants were asked to fill out the Greek translated version of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). Caregivers of patients with T1DM were asked to complete a second questionnaire consisting of questions regarding demographic and socio-economic data of the family and data concerning disease management. Results Thirty-five patients with T1DM (mean decimal age of 14.95 ± 1.90 years) and 35 controls participated in the study. Nine patients were on an insulin pump whereas the rest were on multiple daily injections. The mean total score of the patients' IAT questionnaires was significantly lower compared to the controls (26.26 ± 12.67 vs. 39.91 ± 18.55, p = 0.003). Controls were characterized as exhibiting moderate addictive behavior at a significantly higher percentage than patients (31.43% vs. 2.86%, p = 0.002). All patients on insulin pumps demonstrated normal Internet use. Mild addictive behavior was associated with a lower parental educational level. Finally, level of Internet use (IAT score) was positively associated to glycemic control (HbA1c value) with a correlation that was approaching significance (r = 0.315, p = 0.065). Conclusions Adolescents with T1DM and especially those on an insulin pump exhibit normal Internet use compared to their healthy peers. Time consumed on Internet correlates reversibly with glycemic control.

Impact of Facebook on Glucose Control in Type 1 Diabetes: A Three-Year Cohort Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30291064/),"
As the world is changing, traditional health care services should be adapted for the new era of technology and the Internet. One of the possible ways for communication between health care providers and patients is social media. There are several benefits of social media in health: increased interactions with others; more available and shared information; increased accessibility; social or emotional support.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of Facebook and CareLink software as a possible Internet tool to improve diabetes control in type 1 diabetes patients using a sensor augmented pump.
A total of 67 adolescents with type 1 diabetes and in the age range of 14-23 years were randomized in 2 groups: (1) Traditional group and (2) Internet group. In the traditional group, 34 patients were treated using standard medical protocol with regular clinic visits, where data were uploaded at the clinic and interventions (pump settings-basal bolus insulin and education) were delivered to the patient. In the Internet group, 33 patients were treated using Facebook and CareLink software (Medtronic Diabetes) on a monthly basis, where the data were uploaded by the patient at home and interventions (same as traditional group) were delivered via Facebook (written reports and chats). Both the traditional and Internet group had regular visits every 3 months with standard medical protocol. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was obtained before and every 3 months during the study for a 3-year-period.
The improvement in glucose control was found in both groups: 7.9% (SD 1.4) [62.8 mmol/mol (SD 12.9)] to 6.9% (SD 1.2) [51.9 mmol/mol (SD 10.8)] in the traditional group, and 7.8% (SD 1.8) [61.7 mmol/mol (SD 17.2)] to 6.7% (SD 1.8) [49.7 mmol/mol (SD 17.3)] in the Internet group). Significant improvement of HbA1c (P<.05) was found in favor of the Internet group.
Social media such as Facebook as a tool can assist in standard medical care to improve glucose control in a long term period in adolescents with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy.

Insulin Pump Use in Young Children with Type 1 Diabetes: Sociodemographic Factors and Parent-Reported Barriers.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28581817/),"
Managing type 1 diabetes (T1D) in young children presents challenges to families and caregivers. Pump therapy may reduce challenges and benefit glycemic control. However, pump use is not universal; parent-reported reasons for lack of uptake are not well described.
Parents of children <7, with T1D for ≥1 year, in the T1D Exchange registry completed surveys capturing demographic and clinical characteristics, as well as barriers to pump use. Data from pump users were compared to nonusers, and barriers were analyzed among parents who received pump recommendations, but decided against uptake.
Young children (N = 515) from 41 sites were identified (mean age 5.2 ± 1.2 years, diabetes duration 2.4 ± 1.0 years, 46% female, and 78% Non-Hispanic White). Overall glycemic control was suboptimal (HbA1c 8.1% ± 1.0%). The majority were pump users (64%, n = 331; nonusers 36%, n = 184). Pump users had longer T1D duration (2.5 ± 1.1 years vs. 2.2 ± 1.0 years, P = 0.001), were more likely to have annual household incomes ≥$75,000 (62% vs. 36%, P < 0.001), have a parent with college education or higher (70% vs. 45%, P < 0.001), perform more frequent blood glucose monitoring (7.5 ± 2.5 times/day vs. 6.5 ± 2.3 times/day, P < 0.001), and use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (45% vs. 13%, P < 0.001). Only income, education, frequency of blood glucose monitoring, and CGM use remained significant in a multivariate model including age, sex, ethnicity, and duration of diabetes. Barriers to pump uptake included concerns with physical interference, therapeutic effectiveness, and to a lesser extent, financial burden.
These findings provide an opportunity to address potentially modifiable parent-reported barriers to pump uptake through education and behavioral intervention.

Insulin therapy in neonatal diabetes mellitus: a review of the literature.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28527303/),"
Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare disorder, and guidance is limited regarding its optimal management. We reviewed insulin usage in NDM, with a focus on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
A PubMed search identified 40 reports of patients with NDM treated with insulin published between 1994 and 2016.
Data concerning treatment of NDM are limited. CSII resolves some of the issues associated with insulin therapy in neonates. No clinical trials of CSII in NDM have been reported. Case reports suggest that CSII is a safe and effective means of treating NDM. CSII was initiated to improve glycaemic control, for practicality and convenience, and to overcome difficulties associated with the maintenance of long-term intravenous catheters. CSII can provide better glycaemic control than multiple daily injections, with few hypoglycaemic events. Continuous glucose monitoring integrated with the pump helps provide more precise control of blood glucose levels. CSII generally uses short-acting insulin or rapid-acting insulin analogues, and those that are approved for use in neonates appear to be appropriate for the treatment of NDM using an insulin pump.
Information from case reports indicates that CSII is safe and effective for the management of NDM.

Nivolumab-induced autoimmune diabetes mellitus presenting as diabetic ketoacidosis in a patient with metastatic lung cancer.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28515940/),"
Advances in cancer immunotherapy have generated encouraging results in multiple malignancies refractory to standard chemotherapies. As the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) proliferates, the incidence of autoimmune side effects associated with these agents, termed immune related adverse events (irAE), is expected to increase. The frequency of significant irAE in ICI treated patients is about 10-20% and early recognition is critical to prevent serious morbidity and even mortality. New onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus (DM) associated with immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment is extremely rare, occurring in less than 1% of patients. Autoimmune DM often presents as diabetic ketoacidosis, a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment. We describe the first reported case of a patient with lung cancer who developed autoimmune diabetes after nivolumab treatment and was found to have three diabetes related (islet) autoantibodies present before ICI treatment and seroconversion of another after ICI treatment and onset of autoimmune DM.
A 34 year old African American woman with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was treated with nivolumab in the second line setting after disease progression following standard chemoradiation therapy. After receiving two doses of nivolumab, the patient developed abrupt onset of hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Autoimmune diabetes was diagnosed on the basis of undetectable C-peptide levels, seropositivity of three diabetes related (islet) autoantibodies and absolute insulin dependence. The patient eventually required use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) due to erratic glycemic excursions and multiple readmissions for DKA. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genoyping revealed none of the high risk haplotypes associated with the development of type 1 diabetes. Interestingly, a frozen blood sample obtained prior to treatment with nivolumab tested positive for three of the four diabetes related (islet) autoantibodies despite no prior history of diabetes and no family history of diabetes. Notably, at the time of manuscript preparation, the patient is without evidence of NSCLC recurrence with no further treatment since the nivolumab therapy.
New onset autoimmune diabetes mellitus associated with nivolumab has been described only in case reports and occurs at rates of < 1% in the large clinical trials which garnered FDA approval in the second line setting for NSCLC. As ICI use continues to expand across a wide variety of malignancies, clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for irAE, including autoimmune DM and other endocrinopathies. A multidisciplinary team and thorough education of the patient are recommended to optimize management of new onset adult autoimmune DM. Our patient may have been at greater risk for the development of ICI related autoimmune diabetes due to the presence of three diabetes related autoantibodies prior to therapy; however, about half of the reported cases of autoimmune DM after anti-PD-1 therapy occurred in patients with no detectable diabetes related autoantibodies. Further studies are needed to delineate genetic and immunologic biomarkers that may be useful in identifying patients at risk of developing ICI related autoimmune DM.

[The Way to Closed Loop - Dream and Reality].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28514821/),"
An old dream of patients with type 1 diabetes and medical teams alike is a fully automated insulin therapy. Available sensor-augmented insulin-pumps are able to intervene in insulin therapy by reducing the dose. Aim of several studies is to add an algorithm to the interaction of pump and sensor, so that insulin doses can be regulated fully automatically. Totally closed loop systems are currently not yet available for outpatient use. Hybrid closed loop systems have been approved in the US. They can improve the metabolic status of patients with type 1 diabetes. Risks are similar to sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy. Patients' detailed education will continue to be essential for success.

Behavioral Patterns and Associations with Glucose Control During 12-Week Randomized Free-Living Clinical Trial of Day and Night Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery in Adults with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28463010/),"
We evaluated patterns of meal intake, insulin bolus delivery, and fingerstick glucose measurements during hybrid closed-loop and sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy, including associations with glucose control.
Data were retrospectively analyzed from pump-treated adults with type 1 diabetes who underwent, in random order, 12 weeks free-living closed-loop (n = 32) and 12 weeks SAP (n = 33) periods. We quantified daily patterns of main meals, snacks, prandial insulin boluses, correction boluses, and fingerstick glucose measurements by analyzing data recorded on the study glucometer and on study insulin pump.
We analyzed 1942 closed-loop days and 2530 SAP days. The total number of insulin boluses was reduced during closed-loop versus SAP periods by mean 1.0 per day (95% confidence interval 0.6-1.4, P < 0.001) mainly because of a reduced number of correction boluses by mean 0.7 per day (0.4-1.0, P < 0.001). Other behavioral patterns were unchanged. The carbohydrate content of snacks but not the number of snacks was positively correlated with (1) glycemic variability as measured by standard deviation of sensor glucose (closed-loop P < 0.05; SAP P < 0.01), (2) mean sensor glucose (P < 0.05), and (3) postintervention HbA1c (P < 0.05). Behavioral patterns explained 47% of between-subject variance in glucose variability during SAP period and 30%-33% of variance of means sensor glucose and postintervention HbA1c.
Fewer correction boluses are delivered during closed-loop period. The size of snacks appears to worsen glucose control possibly because of carbohydrate-rich content of snacks. Modifiable behavioral patterns may be important determinants of glucose control.

"The Effect of Retraining on Treatment Success, Quality of Life, and Metabolic Parameters in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Using an Insulin Pump.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28437786/),"
To investigate the effect of insulin pump user retraining on treatment success, quality of life, and metabolic parameters of patients with type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.
A total of 35 subjects participated in this prospective study. All patients were given insulin pump user retraining. Their knowledge level and application skills, metabolic parameters, quality of life, and satisfaction from treatment were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months.
There was significant improvement in patients' knowledge and application skills after insulin pump user retraining (self-assessment of user skills: 69.7 ± 11.5 vs. 76.3 ± 11.3, p < 0.001; knowledge level on technical issues: 3.3 ± 1.1 vs. 4.1 ± 1.8, p = 0.003; glucose monitoring: 27.1 ± 5.8 vs. 29.2 ± 5.6, p = 0.006; management of hyperglycemia: 13.1 ± 3.2 vs. 15.7 ± 3.4, p < 0.001; management of pump and infusion site problems: 8.8 ± 2.6 vs. 10.6 ± 2.6, p = 0.001). Hemoglobin (Hb)A1c levels of patients with poor glycemic control improved after retraining (8.61% ± 0.78 vs. 8.23% ± 0.79, p = 0.02). However, no significant improvement in quality of life and treatment satisfaction parameters were found.
Management of type 1 diabetes in insulin pump users can be significantly improved by retraining. Even a basic short-term retraining program helps patients to increase their knowledge level and ability to more effectively use the insulin pump. The fact that retraining significantly improves glycemic parameters in patients with poor metabolic control indicates that priority should be given to this group of patients. Further studies with individualized training programs in larger sample sizes with long-term follow-up are needed to establish the importance of retraining and create re-education plans for patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump.

We observed the curative effect of the 3C insulin system in combination with non-invasive ventilation in a patient with type 2 diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). The 3C insulin pump is a system of devices that closely monitors and effectively regulates blood glucose levels. Non-invasive ventilation has been shown to be an effective treatment for OSAS. A type 2 diabetes patient with concomitant OSAS was treated with a 3C insulin pump system for real-time continuous glucose monitoring and nocturnal non-invasive ventilation for OSAS. Treatment-induced diabetic remission with improved sleep and reduced hypoglycemic episodes was achieved. Therefore, the 3C insulin pump system, in combination with non-invasive ventilation, is an effective treatment for type 2 diabetes patients with concomitant OSAS.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: Special needs for children.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28425167/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is a very common therapy for children with type 1 diabetes. Due to physiological differences they have other requirements for their insulin pump than adults. The main difference is the need for very low basal rates. Even though most available insulin pumps reach a high accuracy at usual basal rates, accuracy decreases for lower rates. In addition, the lowest delivered amount at 1 time is limiting the fine tuning of the basal rate as well as the option for temporary basal rates. Alarms in case of occlusions depend on accumulation of a certain amount of insulin in the catheter, and therefore the time until such an alarm is triggered is much longer with lower basal rates. Accordingly, the risk for hyperglycemia developing into diabetic ketoacidosis increases. The availability of bolus advisors facilitates the calculation of meal and correction boluses for children and their parents. However, there are some differences between the calculators, and the settings that the calculation is based on are very important. Better connectivity, for example with a system for continuous glucose monitoring, might help to further increase safety in the use of CSII in children. When selecting an insulin pump for a child, the features and characteristics of available pumps should be properly compared to ensure an effective and safe therapy.

Effectiveness of MiniMed 640G with SmartGuard® System for prevention of hypoglycemia in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28417874/),"
Treatment with the MiniMed 640G-SmartGuard® system (640G-SG, sensor-augmented insulin pump system with low predicted glucose suspension feature) has been shown to decrease risk of hypoglycemia without altering metabolic control in patients with T1DM. The study purpose was to assess the impact of 640G-SG on hipoglycemia frequency and on metabolic control in a pediatric population with T1DM.
A retrospective study on 21 children treated with 640G-SG. HbA1C, mean blood glucose (mg/dl), glucose variation coefficient, frequency of hypoglycemia (<70mg/dl) and hyperglycemia (>180mg/dl), daily capillary blood glucose measurements, ketosis/diabetic ketoacidosis, and severe hypoglycemic episodes were analyzed and compared before and during use of the system. Fasting blood glucose, frequency of sensor use and number and duration of system suspension events were also assessed in the last month of use of the system.
All patients used the system continuously (5.0±2.1 months), with a median sensor use of 92%. Significant decreases were seen in hypoglycemia frequency (10.4±5.2% to 7.6±3.3%, p=.044) and number of capillary blood glucose measurements (11.3±2,2 to 8.1±2,1, p<.001), and there was no increase in hyperglycemia frequency (p=.65). Mean system suspension time was 3.1±1.2hours/day (37.3% of overnight stops). Changes in HbA1c, mean blood glucose, and variation coefficient were not significant. No patient experienced diabetic ketoacidosis or severe hypoglycemia.
The sensor-augmented pump with the predictive low glucose suspension management system, as implemented in the 640G-SG system, can help avoid risk of hypoglycemia without significantly affecting metabolic control or causing diabetic ketoacidosis, and decrease the burden of additional capillary blood glucose measurements in our pediatric cohort.

Many implantable systems have been designed for long-term, pulsatile delivery of insulin, but the lifetime of these devices is limited by the need for battery replacement and consequent replacement surgery. Here we propose a batteryless, fully implantable insulin pump that can be actuated by a magnetic field. The pump is prepared by simple-assembly of magnets and constituent units and comprises a drug reservoir and actuator equipped with a plunger and barrel, each assembled with a magnet. The plunger moves to noninvasively infuse insulin only when a magnetic field is applied on the exterior surface of the body. Here we show that the dose is easily controlled by varying the number of magnet applications. Also, pump implantation in diabetic rats results in profiles of insulin concentration and decreased blood glucose levels similar to those observed in rats treated with conventional subcutaneous insulin injections.

A Methodology to Compare Insulin Dosing Recommendations in Real-Life Settings.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28406039/),"
We propose a methodology to analyze complex real-life glucose data in insulin pump users.
Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on insulin pumps were recruited from an academic endocrinology practice. Glucose data, insulin bolus (IB) amounts, and self-reported alcohol consumption and exercise events were collected for 30 days. Rules were developed to retrospectively compare IB recommendations from the insulin pump bolus calculator (IPBC) against recommendations from a proposed decision aid (PDA) and for assessing the PDA's recommendation for exercise and alcohol.
Data from 15 participants were analyzed. When considering instances where glucose was below target, the PDA recommended a smaller dose in 14%, but a larger dose in 13% and an equivalent IB in 73%. For glucose levels at target, the PDA suggested an equivalent IB in 58% compared to the subject's IPBC, but higher doses in 20% and lower in 22%. In events where postprandial glucose was higher than target, the PDA suggested higher doses in 25%, lower doses in 13%, and equivalent doses in 62%. In 64% of all alcohol events the PDA would have provided appropriate advice. In 75% of exercise events, the PDA appropriately advised an IB, a carbohydrate snack, or neither.
This study provides a methodology to systematically analyze real-life data generated by insulin pumps and allowed a preliminary analysis of the performance of the PDA for insulin dosing. Further testing of the methodological approach in a broader diabetes population and prospective testing of the PDA are needed.

Faster insulin action is associated with improved glycaemic outcomes during closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28371223/),"
We aimed to evaluate the relationship between insulin pharmacodynamics and glycaemic outcomes during closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy. We retrospectively analysed data from a multicentre randomized control trial involving 32 adults with type 1 diabetes receiving day-and-night closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy over 12 weeks. We estimated time-to-peak insulin action (t max,IA ) and insulin sensitivity ( S I ) during both interventions, and correlated these with demographic factors and glycaemic outcomes. During both interventions, t max,IA was positively correlated with pre- and post-intervention HbA1c (r = 0.50-0.52, P  < .01) and mean glucose (r = 0.45-0.62, P  < .05), and inversely correlated with time sensor glucose, which was in target range 3.9 to 10 mmol/L (r = -0.64 to -0.47, P  < .05). Increased body mass index was associated with higher t max,I and lower S I (both P  < .05). During closed-loop insulin delivery, t max,IA was positively correlated with glucose variability ( P  < .05). Faster insulin action is associated with improved glycaemic control during closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy.

"Closing the Loop in Adults, Children and Adolescents With Suboptimally Controlled Type 1 Diabetes Under Free Living Conditions: A Psychosocial Substudy.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28367636/),"
The objective was to explore psychosocial experiences of closed loop technology for adults, children, and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents taking part in two multicenter, free-living, randomized crossover home studies.
Participants using insulin pump therapy were randomized to either 12 weeks of automated closed-loop glucose control, then 12 weeks of sensor augmented insulin pump therapy (open loop), or vice versa. Closed loop was used for 24 hours by adults and overnight only by children and adolescents. Participants completed the Diabetes Technology Questionnaire (DTQ) periodically and shared their views in semistructured interviews. This analysis characterizes the impact of the technology, positive and negative aspects of living with the device, alongside participants' expectations, hopes, and anxieties.
Participants were 32 adults, age 38.6 ± 9.6 years, 55% male, and 26 children, mean age 12 years (range 6-18 years), 54% male. DTQ results indicated moderately favorable impact of, and satisfaction with, both open and closed loop interventions, but little evidence of a comparative advantage of either. Key positive themes included perceived improved blood glucose control, improved general well-being, particularly on waking, improved sleep, reduced burden of diabetes, and visibility of data. Key negative themes included having to carry around the equipment and dislike of the pump and second cannula (ie, sensor) inserted.
Overall, participants reported a positive experience of the closed loop technology. Results are consistent with previous research with size of equipment continuing to be a problem. Progress is being made in the usability of the closed-loop system.

Comparison Between Individually and Group-Based Insulin Pump Initiation by Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28366085/),"
Depending on available resources, competencies, and pedagogic preference, initiation of insulin pump therapy can be performed on either an individual or a group basis. Here we compared the two models with respect to resources used.
Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) was used to compare initiating insulin pump treatment in groups (GT) to individual treatment (IT). Activities and cost drivers were identified, timed, or estimated at location. Medical quality and patient satisfaction were assumed to be noninferior and were not measured.
GT was about 30% less time-consuming and 17% less cost driving per patient and activity compared to IT. As a batch driver (16 patients in one group) GT produced an upward jigsaw-shaped accumulative cost curve compared to the incremental increase incurred by IT. Taking the alternate cost for those not attending into account, and realizing the cost of opportunity gained, suggested that GT was cost neutral already when 5 of 16 patients attended, and that a second group could be initiated at no additional cost as the attendance rate reached 15:1.
We found TDABC to be effective in comparing treatment alternatives, improving cost control and decision making. Everything else being equal, if the setup is available, our data suggest that initiating insulin pump treatment in groups is far more cost effective than on an individual basis and that TDABC may be used to find the balance point.

Relative effectiveness of insulin pump treatment over multiple daily injections and structured education during flexible intensive insulin treatment for type 1 diabetes: cluster randomised trial (REPOSE).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28360027/),"
Objective To compare the effectiveness of insulin pumps with multiple daily injections for adults with type 1 diabetes, with both groups receiving equivalent training in flexible insulin treatment.Design Pragmatic, multicentre, open label, parallel group, cluster randomised controlled trial (Relative Effectiveness of Pumps Over MDI and Structured Education (REPOSE) trial).Setting Eight secondary care centres in England and Scotland.Participants Adults with type 1 diabetes who were willing to undertake intensive insulin treatment, with no preference for pumps or multiple daily injections. Participants were allocated a place on established group training courses that taught flexible intensive insulin treatment (""dose adjustment for normal eating,"" DAFNE). The course groups (the clusters) were then randomly allocated in pairs to either pump or multiple daily injections.Interventions Participants attended training in flexible insulin treatment (using insulin analogues) structured around the use of pump or injections, followed for two years.Main outcome measures The primary outcomes were a change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) values (%) at two years in participants with baseline HbA1c value of ≥7.5% (58 mmol/mol), and the proportion of participants achieving an HbA1c value of <7.5%. Secondary outcomes included body weight, insulin dose, and episodes of moderate and severe hypoglycaemia. Ancillary outcomes included quality of life and treatment satisfaction.Results 317 participants (46 courses) were randomised (156 pump and 161 injections). 267 attended courses and 260 were included in the intention to treat analysis, of which 235 (119 pump and 116 injection) had baseline HbA1c values of ≥7.5%. Glycaemic control and rates of severe hypoglycaemia improved in both groups. The mean change in HbA1c at two years was -0.85% with pump treatment and -0.42% with multiple daily injections. Adjusting for course, centre, age, sex, and accounting for missing values, the difference was -0.24% (-2.7 mmol/mol) in favour of pump users (95% confidence interval -0.53 to 0.05, P=0.10). Most psychosocial measures showed no difference, but pump users showed greater improvement in treatment satisfaction and some quality of life domains (dietary freedom and daily hassle) at 12 and 24 months.Conclusions Both groups showed clinically relevant and long lasting decreases in HbA1c, rates of severe hypoglycaemia, and improved psychological measures, although few participants achieved glucose levels currently recommended by national and international guidelines. Adding pump treatment to structured training in flexible intensive insulin treatment did not substantially enhance educational benefits on glycaemic control, hypoglycaemia, or psychosocial outcomes in adults with type 1 diabetes. These results do not support a policy of providing insulin pumps to adults with poor glycaemic control until the effects of training on participants' level of engagement in intensive self management have been determined.Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN61215213.

Prevention of Hypoglycemia With Predictive Low Glucose Insulin Suspension in Children With Type 1 Diabetes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28351897/),"
To investigate whether predictive low glucose management (PLGM) of the MiniMed 640G system significantly reduces the rate of hypoglycemia compared with the sensor-augmented insulin pump in children with type 1 diabetes.
This randomized, two-arm, parallel, controlled, two-center open-label study included 100 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and glycated hemoglobin A1c ≤10% (≤86 mmol/mol) and using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Patients were randomly assigned to either an intervention group with PLGM features enabled (PLGM ON) or a control group (PLGM OFF), in a 1:1 ratio, all using the same type of sensor-augmented insulin pump. The primary end point was the number of hypoglycemic events below 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L), based on sensor glucose readings, during a 14-day study treatment. The analysis was performed by intention to treat for all randomized patients.
The number of hypoglycemic events below 65 mg/dL (3.6 mmol/L) was significantly smaller in the PLGM ON compared with the PLGM OFF group (mean ± SD 4.4 ± 4.5 and 7.4 ± 6.3, respectively; P = 0.008). This was also true when calculated separately for night (P = 0.025) and day (P = 0.022). No severe hypoglycemic events occurred; however, there was a significant increase in time spent above 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in the PLGM ON group (P = 0.0165).
The PLGM insulin suspension was associated with a significantly reduced number of hypoglycemic events. Although this was achieved at the expense of increased time in moderate hyperglycemia, there were no serious adverse effects in young patients with type 1 diabetes.

"Comparative study on treatment satisfaction and health perception in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus on multiple daily injection of insulin, insulin pump and sensor-augmented pump therapy.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28321303/),"
Diabetes management imposes considerable demands on patients. Treatment method used has an impact on treatment satisfaction. We aim to examine the relationship between treatment satisfaction and health perception with the method used for treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents.
We have interviewed patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus using questionnaires to assess treatment satisfaction and health perception. Patients were divided into three groups based on treatment used: multiple daily injection, insulin pump and sensor-augmented pump therapy. Comparison of scores was done between the groups.
A total of 72 patients were enrolled (36 males). Mean age (standard deviation) was 11.4 (4.4) years and duration of diabetes of 4.9 (3.5) years. Mean (standard deviation) HbA1c was 8.1 (1.2). Median (range) duration of sensor use was 17.7 (3-30) days/month. Mean scale for treatment satisfaction and health perception questions was 25.3, 29.7 and 31.7 and 60, 79.7 and 81 for the multiple daily injection, pump and sensor-augmented pump, respectively (p = 0.00). Significant difference was seen between the multiple daily injection and both other groups. Sensor-augmented pump group scored higher than the pump group. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Duration of sensor use showed no correlation with treatment satisfaction.
The method used for diabetes treatment has an impact on patients' satisfaction and health perception in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin pump users have a higher treatment satisfaction and better health perception than those on multiple daily injection. Augmenting pump therapy with sensor use adds value to treatment satisfaction without correlation with the duration of the sensors use.

Comparison of Insulin Pump Therapy and Multiple Daily Injections Insulin Regimen in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes During Ramadan Fasting.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28296467/),"
Fasting Ramadan carries a high risk for patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM). Data on the optimum insulin regimen in these patients are limited.
To compare glucose profiles in patients with T1DM who use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with those who use multiple daily injections (MDI) insulin regimen during Ramadan fast. The primary outcome was rates of hypoglycemia. Other outcomes included glycemic control, number of days needed to break fasting, and acute glycemic complications.
Patients with T1DM who were on CSII or MDI and decided to fast Ramadan were recruited. Glucose data collected using self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were compared in the two groups, CSII and MDI, and glucose control was assessed by measuring serum fructosamine levels.
A total of 156 patients were recruited, 61 on CSII and 95 on MDI. There was no difference in the rate of mild hypoglycemia <4.4 mmol/L (<80 mg/dL) (8.6% ± 6.1% in the CSII group and 9.85% ± 9.34% in the MDI group, P = 0.96). The mean rate of severe hypoglycemia <2.7 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL) was also not different in both groups (0.99% ± 1.7% in the CSII group compared to 1.7% ± 4.7% in the MDI group, P = 0.23). There was no difference in glycemic control as measured by fructosamine levels or the number of days that patients have to stop fasting. Glucose variability was significantly better in CSII group (SMBG; standard deviation [SD] 66.9 ± 15.3 vs. 76.9 ± 29.9, P = 0.02) (CGM; SD 68.1 ± 19.6 vs. 78.7 ± 24.9, P = 0.04). No diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in either group.
In patients with T1DM who fast Ramadan, there was no difference in rates of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia between CSII and MDI. However, CSII was associated with less glucose variability.

"Differences in depression, treatment satisfaction and injection behaviour in adults with type 1 diabetes and different degrees of lipohypertrophy.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28295770/),"
To assess the prevalence of lipohypertrophy, and to compare differences in external, personal and regimen factors in adults with type 1 diabetes and different degrees of lipohypertrophy.
Suboptimal insulin injection behaviour is associated with lipohypertrophy, which may affect insulin absorption and lead to blood glucose fluctuations. Few, if any studies have investigated how external, personal and regimen factors differ in people with type 1 diabetes and different degrees of lipohypertrophy.
A cross-sectional study including adults with type 1 diabetes at a diabetes outpatient clinic in a Norwegian university hospital.
Participants (n = 215) were included consecutively at scheduled appointments. Sociodemographic, diabetes and insulin treatment data, and self-report questionnaires concerning patient activation (Patient Activation Measure), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2), diabetes distress (Diabetes Distress Scale), type D personality (14-item Type D scale), treatment satisfaction (Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire) and motivation (Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire), were collected. Lipohypertrophic injection sites were identified by palpation by diabetes specialist nurses.
Lipohypertrophy was present in 53% and was more frequent in insulin pen users (63%) compared to insulin pump users (34%). Participants with two or more lipohypertrophic areas had higher depression scores, lower treatment satisfaction with glycaemic control, higher bolus doses and reported suboptimal injection behaviour compared to those with no lipohypertrophic areas. There were no differences in patient activation, diabetes distress, type D personality or motivation between the groups.
Compared to pump treatment, pen treatment requires greater awareness of injection technique. Symptoms of depression and lower treatment satisfaction might affect diabetes self-management and glycaemic control, but the association with lipohypertrophy needs further exploration.
Lipohypertrophy is more frequent in insulin pen users compared to pump users. Nurses should focus on injection technique education, and should also consider screening for depressive symptoms and treatment satisfaction as these factors could be associated with development of lipohypertrophy.

Unintended Insulin Pump Delivery in Hyperbaric Conditions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28231029/),"
Unintended pump insulin delivery was reported to occur as a consequence of decreased atmospheric pressure, probably mediated by air bubble formation and the expansion of existing bubbles. This observation has been used to explain some hypoglycemic episodes occurring in patients on insulin pump treatment in between 1 and 1 h 45 min after the flight takeoff. New models of insulin pumps have been introduced in the market, most of them are waterproof certified. It is not clear if in these new pumps the influence of atmospheric pressure changes on the insulin delivery is still present. Moreover, there are no evidences related to the insulin pump operations in hyperbaric conditions, like as during diving activities. Our aim is therefore to verify the eventual variation of insulin pump delivery determined by atmospheric pressure changes in hyperbaric conditions.
Three new models of insulin pumps were tested in hyperbaric conditions at a flow rate of 2 U/h.
Atmospheric pressure variation affected pump insulin release. An increase in the atmospheric pressure from 1 to 1.3 atmosphere (ATA) induced a decrease of pump basal insulin release (about -0.2 U/10 min); conversely, when the atmospheric pressure returned from 1.3 to 1 ATA, an unintended insulin delivery was observed (about +0.3 U/10 min). This phenomenon appeared to be independent of the insulin pump rate and dependent on the presence of air bubbles within the insulin tube setting and cartridge.
Unintended insulin delivery driven by atmospheric pressure changes in hyperbaric conditions occurred in the new insulin pumps available. Patients should pay attention to possible variation of insulin rate during the flight or during diving activities.

Evaluation of a Predictive Low-Glucose Management System In-Clinic.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28221823/),"
Predictions based on continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data are the basis for automatic suspension and resumption of insulin delivery by a predictive low-glucose management feature termed ""suspend before low,"" which is part of the Medtronic MiniMed® 640G combined insulin pump and CGM system. This study assessed the safety and performance characteristics of the system in an in-clinic setting at eight sites.
In-clinic standardized increases in basal insulin delivery rates were used to induce nocturnal hypoglycemia in subjects (14-75 years) with type 1 diabetes wearing the MiniMed 640G system. The ""suspend before low"" feature was set at 65 mg/dL, and as a result, the predictive algorithm suspended insulin delivery when the forecasted glucose was predicted to be ≤85 mg/dL in 30 min (a 20 mg/dL safety buffer). Reference plasma glucose values (Yellow Springs Instruments [YSI], Yellow Springs, OH) were used to establish hypoglycemia and were defined as ≥2 consecutive values ≤65 mg/dL.
Eighty subjects were screened. Among the 69 successful completers, 27 experienced a hypoglycemic event and 42 did not, a prevention rate of 60%. The mean (±standard deviation) YSI value at the time of pump suspension was 101 ± 18.5 mg/dL, and the mean duration of the 68 ""suspend before low"" events was 105 ± 27 min. At 120 min after the start of the pump suspension events, the mean YSI value was 102 ± 34.6 mg/dL.

Influence of health locus of control and fear of hypoglycaemia on glycaemic control and treatment satisfaction in people with Type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28145047/),"
To assess the influence of health locus of control and fear of hypoglycaemia on metabolic control and treatment satisfaction in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.
People with Type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for at least 1 year, sub-classified as an 'acceptable glucose control' group [HbA1c ≤ 58 mmol/mol (7.5%)] and a 'suboptimum glucose control' group [HbA1c > 58 mmol/mol (7.5%)], were consecutively enrolled in a multicentre cross-sectional study. Questionnaires were administered to assess health locus of control [Multidimensional Health Locus of Control (MHLC) scale, with internal and external subscales], fear of hypoglycaemia [Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey II (HFS-II)] and treatment satisfaction [Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)].
We enrolled 214 participants (mean ± sd age 43.4 ± 12.1 years). The suboptimum glucose control group (n = 127) had lower mean ± sd internal MHLC and DTSQ scores than the acceptable glucose control group (19.6 ± 5.2 vs 21.0 ± 5.0, P = 0.04 and 28.8 ± 4.8 vs 30.9 ± 4.5, P < 0.001). HFS-II scores did not differ between the two groups. Internal MHLC score was negatively associated with HbA1c (r = -0.15, P < 0.05) and positively associated with the number of mild and severe hypoglycaemic episodes (r = 0.16, P < 0.05 and r = 0.18, P < 0.001, respectively) and with DTSQ score (r = 0.17, P < 0.05). HFS-II score was negatively associated with DTSQ score (r = -0.18, P < 0.05) and positively with number of severe hypoglycaemic episodes (r = 0.16, P < 0.5).
In adults with Type 1 diabetes receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, high internal locus represents the most important locus of control pattern for achieving good metabolic control.

An Expert Opinion on Advanced Insulin Pump Use in Youth with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28135116/),"
Among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the use of insulin pump therapy has increased since its introduction in the early 1980s. Optimal management of type 1 diabetes mellitus depends on sufficient understanding by patients, their families, and healthcare providers on how to use pump technology. The goal for the use of insulin pump therapy should be to advance proficiency over time from the basics taught at the initiation of pump therapy to utilizing advanced settings to obtain optimal glycemic control. However, this goal is often not met, and appropriate understanding of the full features of pump technology can be lacking. The objective of this review is to provide an expert perspective on the advanced features and use of insulin pump therapy, including practical guidelines for the successful use of insulin pump technology, and other considerations specific to patients and healthcare providers.

"""Let the Algorithm Do the Work"": Reduction of Hypoglycemia Using Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy with Predictive Insulin Suspension (SmartGuard) in Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes Patients.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28099035/),"
A sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) using the MiniMed® 640G system with SmartGuard™ technology allows an automatic stop of insulin delivery based on prediction of low glucose levels. Since pediatric patients are particularly prone to hypoglycemia, this device may offer additional protection beyond conventional sensor-augmented therapy.
This prospective, pediatric multicenter user evaluation assessed 6 weeks of SAP with SmartGuard (threshold setting for hypoglycemia: 70 mg/dL) compared to a preceding period of 2 weeks with SAP only. The primary outcome was the potential reduction in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes and hypoglycemic intensity (area under the curve [AUC] and time <70 mg/dL).
The study included 24 patients with at least 3 months of insulin pump use (average age: 11.6 ± 5.1 years, 15 female, average type 1 diabetes duration: 7.5 ± 4.2 years, mean ± SD) who had on average 3.2 ± 1.0 predictive suspensions/patient/day. The mean sensor glucose minimum during suspension was 78 ± 6 mg/dL and the average suspension time was 155 ± 47 min/day. Use of SmartGuard in patients treated as per the protocol (n = 18) reduced the number of instances in which the glucose level was <70 mg/dL (1.02 ± 0.52 to 0.72 ± 0.36; P = 0.027), as well as AUC <70 mg/dL (0.76 ± 0.73 to 0.38 ± 0.24; P = 0.027) and the time/day the level fell below 70 mg/dL (73 ± 56 to 31 ± 22 min). The reduction of hypoglycemia was not associated with a significant change in mean glucose concentration (171 ± 26 to 180 ± 19 mg/dL, P = 0.111) and HbA1c (7.5% ± 0.5% to 7.6% ± 0.7%, (P = 0.329). Manual resumption of insulin delivery followed by carbohydrate intake resulted in significantly higher glucose levels 1 h after suspension compared to SmartGuard suspensions with automatic resume (190.8 ± 26.5 vs. 138.7 ± 10.3 mg/dL; P < 0.001).
SmartGuard technology significantly reduced the risk for hypoglycemia in pediatric type 1 diabetes patients without increasing HbA1c. Patients must be educated that when using combining predictive low-glucose insulin suspension technology, extra carbohydrate intake in response to an alarm combined with manual resumption is likely to cause rebound hyperglycemia. The best results were achieved when the user did not interfere with pump operation.

Tight control of blood glucose concentration in people with type 1 diabetes predisposes to hypoglycaemia. We aimed to investigate whether day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery can improve glucose control while alleviating the risk of hypoglycaemia in adults with HbA1c below 7·5% (58 mmol/mol).
In this open-label, randomised, crossover study, we recruited adults (aged ≥18 years) with type 1 diabetes and HbA1c below 7·5% from Addenbrooke's Hospital (Cambridge, UK) and Medical University of Graz (Graz, Austria). After a 2-4 week run-in period, participants were randomly assigned (1:1), using web-based randomly permuted blocks of four, to receive insulin via the day-and-night hybrid closed-loop system or usual pump therapy for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-4 week washout period and then the other intervention for 4 weeks. Treatment interventions were unsupervised and done under free-living conditions. During the closed-loop period, a model-predictive control algorithm directed insulin delivery, and prandial insulin delivery was calculated with a standard bolus wizard. The primary outcome was the proportion of time when sensor glucose concentration was in target range (3·9-10·0 mmol/L) over the 4 week study period. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02727231, and is completed.
Between March 21 and June 24, 2016, we recruited 31 participants, of whom 29 were randomised. One participant withdrew during the first closed-loop period because of dissatisfaction with study devices and glucose control. The proportion of time when sensor glucose concentration was in target range was 10·5 percentage points higher (95% CI 7·6-13·4; p<0·0001) during closed-loop delivery compared with usual pump therapy (65·6% [SD 8·1] when participants used usual pump therapy vs 76·2% [6·4] when they used closed-loop). Compared with usual pump therapy, closed-loop delivery also reduced the proportion of time spent in hypoglycaemia: the proportion of time with glucose concentration below 3·5 mmol/L was reduced by 65% (53-74, p<0·0001) and below 2·8 mmol/L by 76% (59-86, p<0·0001). No episodes of serious hypoglycaemia or other serious adverse events occurred.
Use of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery under unsupervised, free-living conditions for 4 weeks in adults with type 1 diabetes and HbA1c below 7·5% is safe and well tolerated, improves glucose control, and reduces hypoglycaemia burden. Larger and longer studies are warranted.

Effect of carbohydrate counting using bolus calculators on glycemic control in type 1 diabetes patients during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27896954/),"
The present study examined the long-term efficacy of insulin pump therapy for type 1 diabetes patients when carried out using carbohydrate counting with bolus calculators for 1 year. A total of 22 type 1 diabetes patients who had just started continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion were examined and divided into two groups: one that was educated about carbohydrate counting using bolus calculators (n = 14); and another that did not use bolus calculators (n = 8). After 1 year, the hemoglobin A1c levels of the patient group that used bolus calculators decreased persistently and significantly (P = 0.0297), whereas those of the other group did not. The bodyweight, total daily dose of insulin and bolus percentage of both groups did not change. Carbohydrate counting using bolus calculators is necessary to achieve optimal and persistent glycemic control in patients undergoing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

Insulin pump failures in Italian children with Type 1 diabetes: retrospective 1-year cohort study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27885706/),"
Insulin pump failure and/or malfunction requiring replacement have not been thoroughly investigated. This study evaluated pump replacement in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy.
Data were collected for all participants younger than 19 years, starting insulin pump therapy before 31 December 2013. For each child, age, disease duration, date of insulin pump therapy initiation, insulin pump model, failure/malfunction/replacement yes/no and reason were considered for the year 2013.
Data were returned by 40 of 43 paediatric centres belonging to the Diabetes Study Group of the Italian Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology. In total, 1574 of 11 311 (13.9%) children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes were using an insulin pump: 29.2% Animas VIBE™ , 9.4% Medtronic MiniMed 715/515™ , 34.3% Medtronic MiniMed VEO™ , 24.3% Accu-Check Spirit Combo™ and 2.8% other models. In 2013, 0.165 insulin pump replacements per patient-year (11.8% due to pump failure/malfunction and 4.7% due to accidental damage) were recorded. Animas VIBE™ (22.1%) and Medtronic MiniMed VEO™ (17.7%) were the most replaced.
In a large cohort of Italian children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes, insulin pump failure/malfunction and consequent replacement are aligned with rates previously reported and higher in more sophisticated pump models.

White Coat Adherence Occurs in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Receiving Intervention to Improve Insulin Pump Adherence Behaviors.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28745096/),"
To assess the occurrence of white coat adherence, defined as an increase in adherence to treatment regimens prior to a study appointment, in adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) using insulin pumps and participating in a randomized adherence intervention trial.
Blood glucose monitoring (BGM) readings, carbohydrate inputs, and insulin boluses delivered were downloaded from the insulin pumps of adolescents, aged 10-18 years, at 3 consecutive T1D study visits. Linear mixed models were used to analyze patterns of BGM, carbohydrate inputs, and insulin boluses delivered in patients who had 40 consecutive days of data stored in their insulin pumps prior to the study visit.
Stratified linear mixed models revealed that adolescents randomized to the Tailored Feedback Intervention group increased their blood glucose monitoring ( P < .01), carbohydrate inputs ( P < .0001), and insulin bolusing ( P < .0001) prior to study appointments. In contrast, white coat adherence did not occur in adolescents randomized to the Treatment as Usual group ( Ps > .42).
White coat adherence may occur in adolescents participating in clinical trials. Meter and insulin pump data downloads representing the 1- to 2-week period prior to a study visit are likely to overestimate actual adherence during the time frame between study visits.

Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pumps and Hypoglycemia Prevention in Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28264173/),"
Hypoglycemia can lead to seizures, unconsciousness, or death. Insulin pump treatment reduces the frequency of severe hypoglycemia compared with multiple daily injections treatment. The addition of a continuous glucose monitor, so-called sensor-augmented pump (SAP) treatment, has the potential to further limit the duration and severity of hypoglycemia as the system can detect and in some systems act on impending and prevailing low blood glucose levels. In this narrative review we summarize the available knowledge on SAPs with and without automated insulin suspension, in relation to hypoglycemia prevention. We present evidence from randomized trials, observational studies, and meta-analyses including nonpregnant individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus. We also outline concerns regarding SAPs with and without automated insulin suspension. There is evidence that SAP treatment reduces episodes of moderate and severe hypoglycemia compared with multiple daily injections plus self-monitoring of blood glucose. There is some evidence that SAPs both with and without automated suspension reduces the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events compared with insulin pumps without continuous glucose monitoring.

Changes in Quality of Diabetes Care and Morbidity over 20 Years in People with Type 1 Diabetes and Long Diabetes Duration: The JEVIN Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28008584/),"
Background: The JEVIN trial started as a cross-sectional study in 1989/90 in Jena, a city of the former German Democratic Republic. At that time, the centralized diabetes care system was broken down and restarted 10 years later; structured treatment and teaching programs were implemented, blood glucose self-monitoring, insulin pump-systems and analogue insulin were introduced. We surveyed people with type-1-diabetes of the baseline JEVIN trial in a 20-year follow-up. Methods: 131 patients with type-1-diabetes were analyzed in 1989/90. Of the living population in 2009/10 (n=104), 83 persons were identified and 75 persons with a mean diabetes duration of 35 years were reexamined regarding HbA1c, self-monitoring, diabetes therapy, severe hypoglycemia, diabetic late complications and compared with the results of the same persons in 1989/90. Results: HbA1c decreased from 57.1 mmol/mol in 1989/90 to 52.7 mmol/mol in 2009/10 (7.4 -7.0%; p=0.049). Self-monitoring of blood glucose increased from 2 to 35 tests/week (p<0.001). 100%-use of animal insulin changed to human and analogue insulin therapy. The incidence of severe hypoglycemia increased from 0.1 to 0.16/patient-year. Retinopathy increased from 29 to 69% (p<0.001), nephropathy from 5 to 27% (p<0.001) and neuropathy from 13 to 43% (p<0.001). 17% had no diabetic late complications. Conclusions: The JEVIN trial shows a significant improve in HbA1c in the past 20 years. Severe hypoglycemia occurred rarely and 17% were still free of any diabetic late complication after 35 years of diabetes. This indicates a good quality of diabetes care in a German setting.

Home use of a bihormonal bionic pancreas versus insulin pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes: a multicentre randomised crossover trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28007348/),"
The safety and effectiveness of a continuous, day-and-night automated glycaemic control system using insulin and glucagon has not been shown in a free-living, home-use setting. We aimed to assess whether bihormonal bionic pancreas initialised only with body mass can safely reduce mean glycaemia and hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes who were living at home and participating in their normal daily routines without restrictions on diet or physical activity.
We did a random-order crossover study in volunteers at least 18 years old who had type 1 diabetes and lived within a 30 min drive of four sites in the USA. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) in blocks of two using sequentially numbered sealed envelopes to glycaemic regulation with a bihormonal bionic pancreas or usual care (conventional or sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy) first, followed by the opposite intervention. Both study periods were 11 days in length, during which time participants continued all normal activities, including athletics and driving. The bionic pancreas was initialised with only the participant's body mass. Autonomously adaptive dosing algorithms used data from a continuous glucose monitor to control subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon. The coprimary outcomes were the mean glucose concentration and time with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L, analysed over days 2-11 in participants who completed both periods of the study. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02092220.
We randomly assigned 43 participants between May 6, 2014, and July 3, 2015, 39 of whom completed the study: 20 who were assigned to bionic pancreas first and 19 who were assigned to the comparator first. The mean CGM glucose concentration was 7·8 mmol/L (SD 0·6) in the bionic pancreas period versus 9·0 mmol/L (1·6) in the comparator period (difference 1·1 mmol/L, 95% CI 0·7-1·6; p<0·0001), and the mean time with CGM glucose concentration less than 3·3 mmol/L was 0·6% (0·6) in the bionic pancreas period versus 1·9% (1·7) in the comparator period (difference 1·3%, 95% CI 0·8-1·8; p<0·0001). The mean nausea score on the Visual Analogue Scale (score 0-10) was greater during the bionic pancreas period (0·52 [SD 0·83]) than in the comparator period (0·05 [0·17]; difference 0·47, 95% CI 0·21-0·73; p=0·0024). Body mass and laboratory parameters did not differ between periods. There were no serious or unexpected adverse events in the bionic pancreas period of the study.
Relative to conventional and sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, the bihormonal bionic pancreas, initialised only with participant weight, was able to achieve superior glycaemic regulation without the need for carbohydrate counting. Larger and longer studies are needed to establish the long-term benefits and risks of automated glycaemic management with a bihormonal bionic pancreas.

Physical activity and sedentary behavior levels in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump or injection therapy - The importance of parental activity profile.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27989545/),"
In children and adolescents, treatments for type 1 diabetes (T1D) have recently evolved with the introduction of the insulin pump. However, little is known about how a pump is associated with physical activity (PA) patterns. The goal of the study was to examine the activity profile of Canadian children and adolescents with T1D according to their insulin treatment (pump vs. injections), as well as barriers to exercise and parental lifestyle habits. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 188 subjects with T1D aged 6 to 17 and their parents at the endocrinology clinic of Sainte-Justine's University Hospital Center (Montreal, Canada). Sixty percent of patients used an insulin pump. There were no significant differences in any components of the PA profile, sedentary habits, and exercise barriers between subjects using injections and those using a pump. Fear of hypoglycemia was the main PA barrier in both treatment groups. A more diverse PA practice by parents was associated with more moderate-to-vigorous PA and less screen time in adolescents. In conclusion, type of treatment was not associated with more activity in pediatric patients with T1D and a varied parental PA profile was the main factor of interest for healthier habits in adolescents with T1D.

Lower Basal Insulin Dose is Associated with Better Control in Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974167/),"
To test the hypothesis that lower basal insulin doses may be paradoxically associated with better diabetic control, we assessed the association between the basal insulin dose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level in a group of children and young adults with type 1 diabetes.
This was a retrospective study of 89 patients with type 1 diabetes (mean age, 14.67 ± 4.8 years; range, 3-29 years) treated in a single outpatient clinic. Forty-six of the 89 patients were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, and the other 43 were treated with multiple daily injections (glargine as basal insulin). The daily basal insulin dose was taken either as downloaded from the insulin pump or as registered in the chart at the most recent clinic visit. Glucose data were taken from computerized registration of downloaded patient glucometers. The mean time between data download and HbA1c determination was 0.9 ± 0.78 months. HbA1c level and basal insulin dose were entered with other variables in a multivariable linear regression model.
There was a significant correlation between injection of less total daily basal insulin and lower HbA1c level (Pearson correlation, 0.441; P < .001). Optimal HbA1c level was associated with use of 0.28 ± 0.08 U/kg/day of basal insulin (35 ± 10% basal/total).
With lower basal insulin levels, lower HbA1C was achieved despite the same total bolus dose. The optimal basal dose as determined by this study is similar to that found in fasting individuals of similar age.

No effect of yeast-like fungi on lipid metabolism and vascular endothelial growth factor level in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27955676/),"
The objective of the research was to investigate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the context of lipid metabolism and amount of yeast-like fungi colonizing the digestive tract in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
The study included 45 children with T1DM and 27 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. In the study sample 33 T1DM patients were administered insulin pump therapy and 12 T1DM patients were administered multiple daily injections with insulin pen devices. All T1DM patients were free of micro- and macrovascular complications. In T1DM patients and healthy controls biochemical tests were performed and measurements of yeast-like fungi colonizing the alimentary tract were conducted. Moreover all study subjects had their serum VEGF levels measured with ELISA test.
The subgroup of children and adolescents with T1DM and yeast-like fungus colony number 10^3 CFU/g was shown statistically significantly lower HbA1c levels, and lower but not statistically significantly total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and VEGF levels versus T1DM patients with the amount of yeast-like fungi 10^6 CFU/g. Moreover higher HDL levels were observed in this subgroup versus T1DM patients with the amount of yeast-like fungi 10^6 CFU/g although the difference was not statistically significant.
Our study has shown no influence of yeast-like fungi on lipid metabolism and VEGF level in children and adolescents with T1DM. Comprehensive treatment of T1DM patients and intensive insulin therapy with help of personal insulin pumps can reduce or prevent the development of long-term diabetic complications. Further studies in this field are needed.

[Prevalence of Dental Caries in Type 1 Diabetic Patients Treated with Insulin Pump].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27914157/),"
Type 1 diabetes mellitus and oral health are strictly related on a reciprocal basis, and an increased susceptibility to a wide variety of oral diseases is recognised in these patients. The aim of the present study was to establish a relationship between the prevalence of dental caries in Type 1 diabetic patients treated with insulin pump and that of non-diabetic patients.
An observational clinical study of analytical and cross-sectional nature was conducted. The sample consisted of 30 adults with diabetes mellitus treated with insulin pump (selected from the Coimbra Hospital and Universitary Centre) and 30 nondiabetic adults (selected from the ones accompanying the diabetic patients). One dentist evaluated all of the patients between January and May of 2015 in the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Coimbra. During the clinical evaluation a case report form adapted to the objectives of the investigation was completed. Data analysis was performed and the significance level was set at 5%.
Diabetic patients showed similar levels on the caries and plaque index to non-diabetic patients. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups as regards oral hygiene habits and frequency of visits to the dentist. Discussão: Although diabetics' diet is less abundant in carbohydrates, which provides a smaller exposure to cariogenic food, the regularity of meals can increase the risk of caries since the critical pH for demineralization is reached frequently throughout the day. However, the existence of a chronic condition may determine a high concern for general preventive care, resulting in an overall improvement of their oral health, which could justify the results.
Type 1 diabetic patients treated with insulin pump don't have a higher prevalence of dental caries.

Insulin Pump Failures: Has There Been an Improvement? Update of a Prospective Observational Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27835049/),"
Insulin pump failures had been assessed in our center by a prospective observational study from 2001 to 2007. The aim of this study was to update our data since 2008 and to determine whether there exist specific risk factors for insulin pump failures.
All insulin pump defects were prospectively collected between 2008 and 2013 in a monocentric cohort of 350 new pumps. Clinical consequences were recorded. Brand and model of pumps and type of defects and patients' characteristics (gender, type of diabetes, age at diabetes diagnosis, age at first pump, pump treatment duration, number of previous pumps, and number of previous pump failures) were tested for possible association with insulin pump failure.
Malfunctions occurred in 239 (68%) pumps. The incidence rate was 33/100 pump-years. There were 28 (12%) complete failures, 17 (7%) alarms, 83 (35%) mechanical defects, and 105 (44%) minor defects. Survival curves did not differ according to pump brand and model. Hyperglycemia occurred in 2.9% of cases. In multivariate analysis, only patient age less than 40 years at the initiation of pump therapy was associated with higher risk of malfunction (hazard ratio 1.64; 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.24; P = 0.002).
Pump malfunctions remain common with modern pumps. We report less complete failures than in our previous study. This could be because of improvement in quality of pumps or to our strategy of systematic screening and replacement in case of mechanical defects.

Evaluation of the Effect of Carbohydrate Intake on Postprandial Glucose in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Treated With Insulin Pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27137456/),"
It has been suggested that dietary freedom in functional insulin therapy may be detrimental to glycemic control in type 1 diabetes. This study evaluates the effect of carbohydrate intake on glycemic control and postprandial blood glucose concentrations.
Insulin pump data from 148 adults with type 1 diabetes, trained in functional insulin therapy, using pumps for ≥6 months, with ≥2 weeks of consecutive downloaded data, ≥80% use of a bolus calculator, ≥3 capillary blood glucose tests/day, and a concurrent HbA1C, were analyzed. More detailed periprandial data (pre- and postmeal glucose, carbohydrate intake, insulin bolus) were collected from a subset of 105 downloads (3495 meals).
Mean (± SD) age of contributors was 43 ± 13 years, HbA1C 7.84% ± 0.93 (62.19 mmol/mol); daily carbohydrate intake 166 ± 71 g. HbA1C reduced with increased meals/day (r = -.370, P < .0005) and increased with mean carbohydrate content/meal (r = .198, P = .043). However, total daily carbohydrate intake had a weak but significant negative association with HbA1C (r = -.181, P = .027). There was no association between standard deviation of carbohydrate intake and HbA1C (r = .021, P = .802) or between meal carbohydrate content and postprandial change in blood glucose (r = -.004, P = .939) for meals with early postprandial (1-3 hours; n = 390) readings. There was a weak positive correlation (r = .184, P = .008) between meal carbohydrate content and late (4-7 hours; n = 390) postprandial readings.
With appropriate training, patients using insulin pumps can accommodate a flexible diet with variable carbohydrate intake, without detriment to glycemic control. However, large carbohydrate meals may contribute to poorer outcomes, through impact on late postprandial glycemia.

Excess weight gain during insulin pump therapy is associated with higher basal insulin doses.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27777901/),"
While higher total daily dose (TDD) of insulin has been associated with excess weight gain on insulin pump therapy, the role of higher total basal dose (TBD) of insulin on weight gain has not been studied. We evaluated the impact of higher TBD on weight gain in relationship to glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypoglycemic episodes, and change in body mass index (BMI) z score in a group of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
One-year data from 91 (54 Female/37 Male) patients (2.3-17.8 years of age), transitioned from basal-bolus regimen to insulin pump therapy were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups based on changes in BMI z score: Group 1 (no change or decrease) and Group 2 (increase).
Thirty-three patients in Group 1 and 58 patients in Group 2. The two groups had similar TDD (0.9 ± 0.2 vs. 0.8 ± 0.2 U/kg/day), however Group 1 had a higher bolus: basal insulin ratio (1.8 ± 0.6 vs. 1.5 ± 0.6, p < 0.05). While Groups 1 and 2 had similar HbA1c values (7.7 ± 0.7 vs. 7.70 ± 0.6 %; p = 0.79) and activity levels (2.2 ± 0.6 vs. 2.2 ± 0.7; p = 0.15), Group 2 had higher rates of hypoglycemic episodes (1.0 ± 0.4 vs. 1.5 ± 0.9, p < 0.01).
Excess weight gain was associated with lower bolus to basal insulin ratios independent of glycemic control and activity level. Evaluation of bolus and basal insulin doses during insulin therapy is warranted in order to avoid excess weight gain.

Effectiveness of Automated Insulin Management Features of the MiniMed® 640G Sensor-Augmented Insulin Pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27672710/),"
Automated insulin management features of the MiniMed® 640G sensor-augmented pump system include suspension in response to predicted low sensor glucose (SG) values (""suspend before low""), suspension in response to existing low SG values (""suspend on low""), and automatic restarting of basal insulin delivery upon SG recovery. The effectiveness of these features was evaluated using CareLink® software data.
Anonymized data from MiniMed 640G system users (n = 4818), MiniMed 530G system users (n = 39,219), and MiniMed Paradigm® Veo™ system users (n = 43,193) who voluntarily uploaded pump and sensor data were retrospectively analyzed. Comparisons were made between days in which system features were enabled at any time and those in which they were not. Comparisons were also made between pump suspension events for which insulin delivery was automatically or manually resumed and between glycemic parameters of users who switched from the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system to the MiniMed 640G system.
Days in which the MiniMed 640G ""suspend before low"" feature was enabled had lower percentages of SG readings ≤70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or ≥240 mg/dL (13.3 mmol/L) than days when it was not enabled (P < 0.001 for each). Users who switched from the MiniMed Paradigm Veo system to the MiniMed 640G system had fewer excursions below ≤70 mg/dL (P < 0.001) and ≥240 mg/dL (P < 0.001). SG values following automatically resumed pump suspension events recovered more rapidly and had a more stabilized endpoint than following manually resumed events.
Automated insulin management features of the MiniMed 640G system can reduce the frequency of both high and low SG values and help stabilize SG after resumption of insulin delivery.

Young people with Type 1 diabetes of non-white ethnicity and lower socio-economic status have poorer glycaemic control in England and Wales.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26802317/),"
The impact of ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) on glycaemic control during childhood Type 1 diabetes is poorly understood in England and Wales.
We studied 18 478 children with Type 1 diabetes (< 19 years) attending diabetes clinics and included in the 2012-2013 National Paediatric Diabetes Audit. Self-identified ethnicity was categorized as white, Asian, black, mixed, other and 'not-stated' (did not to divulge ethnicity). A small area measure of SES was estimated from the Index of Multiple Deprivation. Multiple linear regression was used to assess associations between ethnicity, SES and glycaemic control (mean HbA1c levels) accounting for age, gender and diabetes duration. The impact of insulin pump use on the ethnicity/SES-HbA1c associations was tested in 13 962 children.
All children from minority ethnic groups had higher mean HbA1c compared with white children, with largest differences observed in black and mixed ethnicities [8 mmol/mol (2.9%), 95% CI 5-11 and 7 mmol/mol (2.8%), 95% CI 5-9, respectively]. Lower SES was associated with higher mean HbA1c with a dose effect. The lowest SES group had a mean HbA1c that was 7 mmol/mol (2.8%) (95% CI 6-8) higher compared with the highest SES group, adjusted for ethnicity. Estimates for ethnicity were attenuated, but significant on adjustment for SES. Fewer non-white (white 20.3 vs. black 5.5%) and deprived (least deprived 21.1 vs. most deprived 13.2%) children were on insulin pump therapy. Ethnicity and SES remained significant predictors of HbA1c after accounting for insulin pump use.
The association between ethnicity and glycaemic control persists after adjustment for deprivation and pump use. An alternative approach to intensive insulin therapy might benefit these vulnerable children.

Demographic and regional disparities in insulin pump utilization in a setting of universal funding: a New Zealand nationwide study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27650535/),"
Insulin pumps have been publically funded in New Zealand since 2012 for patients who meet certain clinical criteria; however, the patterns of utilization have not been described. We undertook a nationwide study to estimate the annual proportions of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus who used a pump between 2012 and 2014, overall, and according to sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic position, and region.
We used data from the New Zealand Virtual Diabetes Register and routinely collected national demographic, health, and pharmaceutical dispensing data from the Ministry of Health to identify patients with type 1 diabetes and to calculate the overall, and subgroup, proportions using pumps.
Between 2012 and 2014, funded pump use among patients with type 1 diabetes (n = 13,727) increased from 1.8 to 9.3 % overall; however, there were differences in uptake according to demographic characteristics and region. In 2014, proportionate pump use was significantly higher in females versus males (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.0 [95 % confidence interval 1.8-2.3]), in those aged <20 years, and in some regions. Māori (indigenous people), Pacific, and Asian patients were significantly less likely to use pumps than New Zealand Europeans (ORs 0.30 [0.23-0.41], 0.26 [0.14-0.46], 0.22 [0.14-0.35], respectively), as were those in the most versus the least deprived socioeconomic decile (OR 0.36 [0.25-0.52]).
It is essential to explore the factors driving differential insulin pump uptake, in both New Zealand and elsewhere, if all patients are to have equal opportunity to benefit from intensive diabetes management.

All women were asked to complete the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and other validated multiple-choice questionnaires assessing sexual-related distress (Female Sexual Distress Scale, FSDS), quality of life (SF-36 Health Survey), physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire), depressive symptoms (Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, SRDS) and diabetes-related problems (Diabetes Integration Scale ATT-19). FSD was diagnosed according to a FSFI score higher than 26.55 and a FSDS score lower than 15.
The overall prevalence of FSD in diabetic and control women was 20 and 15 %, respectively (P = 0.446). Compared with the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion group and control women, diabetic women on multiple daily injections (MDI) had lower global FSFI score (P = 0.007), FSDS score (P = 0.045) and domains such as arousal (P = 0.006), lubrication and satisfaction scores (P < 0.001 for both). In the multiple regression analysis, only the mental component summary (P = 0.047) and the SRDS score (P = 0.042) were independent predictors of FSFI score in the overall diabetic women.
Young women with type 1 diabetes wearing an insulin pump show a prevalence of sexual dysfunction similar to that of healthy age-matched women, but sexual function was significantly impaired in diabetic women on MDI therapy. Depression and the mental health status were independent predictors for FSD in diabetic women.

"Home Use of Day-and-Night Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery in Suboptimally Controlled Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes: A 3-Week, Free-Living, Randomized Crossover Trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27612500/),"
This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery in adolescents with type 1 diabetes under free-living conditions.
In an open-label randomized crossover study, 12 suboptimally controlled adolescents on insulin pump therapy (mean ± SD age 14.6 ± 3.1 years; HbA1c 69 ± 8 mmol/mol [8.5 ± 0.7%]; duration of diabetes 7.8 ± 3.5 years) underwent two 21-day periods in which hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery was compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in random order. During the closed-loop intervention, a model predictive algorithm automatically directed insulin delivery between meals and overnight. Participants used a bolus calculator to administer prandial boluses.
The proportion of time that sensor glucose was in the target range (3.9-10 mmol/L; primary end point) was increased during the closed-loop intervention compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy by 18.8 ± 9.8 percentage points (mean ± SD; P < 0.001), the mean sensor glucose level was reduced by 1.8 ± 1.3 mmol/L (P = 0.001), and the time spent above target was reduced by 19.3 ± 11.3 percentage points (P < 0.001). The time spent with sensor glucose levels below 3.9 mmol/L was low and comparable between interventions (median difference 0.4 [interquartile range -2.2 to 1.3] percentage points; P = 0.33). Improved glucose control during closed-loop was associated with increased variability of basal insulin delivery (P < 0.001) and an increase in the total daily insulin dose (53.5 [39.5-72.1] vs. 51.5 [37.6-64.3] units/day; P = 0.006). Participants expressed positive attitudes and experience with the closed-loop system.
Free-living home use of day-and-night closed-loop in suboptimally controlled adolescents with type 1 diabetes is safe, feasible, and improves glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Larger and longer studies are warranted.

Randomized Cross-Over Study Comparing Two Infusion Sets for CSII in Daily Life.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27605591/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy is a valuable option especially for people with type 1 diabetes. Although insulin infusion sets (IIS) are essential components of most insulin pump systems, only few studies have been conducted on their performance and safety. In this study 2 IIS with soft cannulas were compared.
In an open-label, randomized, crossover, multicenter 8-week study 80 type 1 diabetic subjects on CSII (20-74 years, mean 46.5 ± 12.9 years, 58.8% male) were enrolled to evaluate the use of 2 IIS. The Accu-Chek® FlexLink Plus (FL Plus) and the Accu-Chek® FlexLink infusion set (FL) were used 4 weeks each under real-life conditions at home. All patients had to record details about every IIS change in a diary. Insertion-related pain was assessed by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS).
The mean pain noted during insertion was similar for both IIS (VAS 6.1 ± 6.4 mm for the FL Plus and 5.8 ± 6.3 mm for the FL, P = .92). 20.0% of the 895 IIS changes with FL Plus and 16.0% of the 854 with FL were unplanned. During the 4243 patient days of the study, 13 patients had adverse events. Among these, 2 serious adverse events occurred. Both serious events and 1 nonserious adverse event were considered as related to the IIS. Of the patients, 18.7% had kinked cannulas. Most patients were satisfied with both IIS.
Both IIS are safe and effective. The 2 IIS did not differ from each other with respect to pain observed during insertion.

Characterization of Exercise and Alcohol Self-Management Behaviors of Type 1 Diabetes Patients on Insulin Pump Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27595712/),"
There is a lack of systematic ways to analyze how diabetes patients use their insulin pumps to self-manage blood glucose to compensate for alcohol ingestion and exercise. The objective was to analyze ""real-life"" insulin dosing decisions occurring in conjunction with alcohol intake and exercise among patients using insulin pumps.
We recruited adult type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients on insulin pump therapy. Participants were asked to maintain their daily routines, including those related to exercising and consuming alcohol, and keep a 30-day journal on exercise performed and alcohol consumed. Thirty days of insulin pump data were downloaded. Participants' actual insulin dosing behaviors were compared against their self-reported behaviors in the setting of exercise and alcohol.
Nineteen T1D patients were recruited and over 4000 interactions with the insulin pump were analyzed. The analysis exposed variability in how subjects perceived the effects of exercise/alcohol on their blood glucose, inconsistencies between self-reported and observed behaviors, and higher rates of blood glucose control behaviors for exercise versus alcohol.
Compensation techniques and perceptions on how exercise and alcohol affect their blood glucose levels vary between patients. Improved individualized educational techniques that take into consideration a patient's unique life style are needed to help patients effectively apply alcohol and exercise compensation techniques.

Evaluation of Pump Discontinuation and Associated Factors in the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27595711/),"
The objectives of this study were to examine factors associated with insulin pump discontinuation among children and adults followed longitudinally for 1 year in the multicenter T1D Exchange clinic registry, and to provide participant-reported reasons for stopping pump therapy.
We longitudinally followed 8935 participants of all ages using an insulin pump at the time of registry enrollment. Logistic regressions were used to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with pump discontinuation. Pump discontinuation was self-reported by participants on a first annual follow-up survey.
The overall frequency of pump discontinuation was 3%. Discontinuation was higher in adolescents (4%) and young adults (4%) than in younger children (3%) or older adults (1%). In multivariate analysis of children between 6 and <13 and 13 and <18 years, participants who discontinued pump use were more likely to have higher HbA1c levels at baseline (adjusted P < .001 for both). The top participant-reported reasons for discontinuing the pump included problems with wearability (57%), disliking the pump or feeling anxious (44%), and problems with glycemic control (30%).
In T1D Exchange registry participants, insulin pump discontinuation is uncommon, but more prevalent among adolescents and young adults, and youth with poor glycemic control. Given the known benefits of pump therapy, these populations should be targeted for support and education on troubleshooting pump use. Common reasons for discontinuation should also be considered in future device design and technological improvement.

"Insulin pump-associated adverse events are common, but not associated with glycemic control, socio-economic status, or pump/infusion set type.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27585938/),"
While there have been many outcome-focussed studies examining insulin pump therapy, only a few have looked at potential adverse events (AEs), with none examining the relationship between AEs and pump/infusion set type, ethnicity or socio-economic status. In addition, current data on the incidence and characteristics of pump-associated AEs are confined to one paediatric centre. We aimed to describe the incidence, characteristics and potential predictors of insulin pump-associated AEs in New Zealand adults and children with T1DM.
We approached adults and families of children with T1DM on insulin pumps in four main New Zealand centres. Participants completed a questionnaire examining pump-related issues they had experienced in the preceding 12 months.
Response rate was 64 % with 174 of 270 eligible people participating in the study. 84 % of subjects reported one or more AEs, with an overall AE incidence of 3.42 per person/year (95 % CI 3.14, 3.73). An event serious enough to require a hospital presentation occurred in 9.8 %, all but one reporting high ketones or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Set/site problems were the AE most commonly reported (by 53 % of respondents), followed by cutaneous complications (43 %) and pump malfunction (38 %). Few predictors of AEs (of any type) were found; however, a negative binomial regression model found that a longer duration of pumping (p = 0.018) and age <18 years (p = 0.043) were both associated with fewer AEs (all types combined).
Insulin pump-associated AEs are very common. However, few variables are predictive of them with no relationships seen with glycaemic control, socio-economic status, pump manufacturer or infusion set type. Based on these findings, AEs should be anticipated in both adults and children, with anticipatory patient education and training recommended for their successful and safe use.

Low socioeconomic status is associated with adverse events in children and teens on insulin pumps under a universal access program: a population-based cohort study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27547416/),"
To describe adverse events in pediatric insulin pump users since universal funding in Ontario and to explore the role of socioeconomic status and 24-hour support.
Population-based cohort study of youth (<19â€…years) with type 1 diabetes (n=3193) under a universal access program in Ontario, Canada, from 2006 to 2013. We linked 2012 survey data from 33 pediatric diabetes centers to health administrative databases. The relationship between patient and center-level characteristics and time to first diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) admission or death was tested using a Cox proportional hazards model and the rate of diabetes-related emergency department visits and hospitalizations with a Poisson model, both using generalized estimating equations.
The rate of DKA was 5.28/100 person-years and mortality 0.033/100 person-years. Compared with the least deprived quintile, the risk of DKA or death for those in the most deprived quintile was significantly higher (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.38) as was the rate of diabetes-related acute care use (RR 1.60, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.00). 24-hour support was not associated with these outcomes. Higher glycated hemoglobin, prior DKA, older age, and higher nursing patient load were associated with a higher risk of DKA or death.
The safety profile of pump therapy in the context of universal funding is similar to other jurisdictions and unrelated to 24-hour support. Several factors including higher deprivation were associated with an increased risk of adverse events and could be used to inform the design of interventions aimed at preventing poor outcomes in high-risk individuals.

"Impact of deprivation, ethnicity, and insulin pump therapy on developmental trajectories of diabetes control in COB type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27534520/),"
There is marked variation in diabetes outcomes for children and adolescents across the UK. We used modelling techniques to examine the independent contributions of deprivation, ethnicity, insulin pump use, and health service use on HbA1c trajectories across adolescence.
Prospective data from a large UK Paediatric & Adolescent Diabetes Service on subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D) aged 9-17 years from January 2008 to December 2013: 2560 HbA1c datapoints were available on 384 patients [193 (50.4%) female]. Sequential multilevel growth models assessed the effects of sex, duration of diabetes, deprivation, ethnicity, insulin pump use, and health service use on HbA1c . Growth mixture models were used to identify discrete HbA1c trajectories across adolescence.
Mean clinic HbA1c decreased from 2008 to 2013 by 0.122% (95% confidence interval: 0.034, 0.210; P = .007) per year. The optimal multilevel growth model showed mean HbA1c increased with age (B = 0.414, P < .0001), and that mean HbA1c was predicted by white/British ethnicity (B = -0.748, P = .004), clinic visits (B = 0.041, P = .04), and pump use (B = -0.568, P < .0001) but not deprivation. The optimal mixture model was a four trajectory group solution, with 45.1% in Good Control, 39.6% with Deteriorating Control, 6.5% with Rapidly Deteriorating Control, and 8.8% in Poor Control across adolescence. Only pump use predicted trajectory group membership, being protective against membership of all other trajectories compared with Good Control.
Increasing uptake of insulin pumps and ensuring access to health services are likely to be the most effective means of reducing inequalities in outcomes of T1D in children and young people.

Insulin Infusion Set Use: European Perspectives and Recommendations.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27526329/),"
Insulin pump users worldwide depend on insulin infusion sets (IISs) for predictable delivery of insulin to the subcutaneous tissue. Yet emerging data indicates that IISs are associated with many pump-related adverse events and may contribute to potentially life-threatening problem of unexplained hyperglycemia. The relative scarcity of published research on IISs to date, the heterogeneity of regional IIS practices, and the increasing demand for international standards guiding their use prompted convening of a panel of diabetologists and diabetes nurse educators last February, in Milan, Italy, to discuss a framework for optimizing IIS practice in Europe. The multinational panel was tasked, first, with identifying the often-overlooked IIS issues that can affect patients' experience of pump therapy-e.g., partial or complete blockage of the cannula, skin pathologies, unpredictable variations in insulin absorption, dislodgment, and the demands of site rotation and set changes-and, second, with establishing direction for developing cohesive protocols to assure long-term success. As reported in this article, the panel examined IIS-related complications of pump therapy encountered in clinical practice, considered country-wide policies to prevent and mitigate such complications, and updated priorities for improving IIS education on issues of device selection, skin care, and troubleshooting unexplained hyperglycemia. These recommendations may be more relevant with the possibility of closed-loop systems available in the near future.

Diabetes induction by total pancreatectomy in minipigs with simultaneous splenectomy: a feasible approach for advanced diabetes research.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27506420/),"
Safe and reliable diabetes models are a key prerequisite for advanced preclinical studies on diabetes. Chemical induction is the standard model of diabetes in rodents and also widely used in large animal models of non-human primates and minipigs. However, uncertain efficacy, the potential of beta-cell regeneration, and relevant side effects are debatable aspects particularly in large animals. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate a surgical approach of total pancreatectomy combined with splenectomy for diabetes induction in an exploratory study in Goettingen minipigs.
Total pancreatectomy was performed in Goettingen minipigs (n = 4) under general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation. Prior to surgery, a central venous line was established for drug application and blood sampling. After median laparotomy, splenectomy was performed and the lobular pancreas was carefully dissected with particular attention to the duodenal vascular arcade. Close monitoring of blood glucose was initiated immediately after surgery by standard glucometer measurement or continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS). Exogenous insulin was given by multiple daily subcutaneous (s.c.) injections or via insulin pump systems (CSII). Complete endogenous insulin deficiency was confirmed by intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) and measurement of c-peptide. For establishing a suitable regimen for diabetes management, the animals were followed for 4-6 weeks.
Following pancreatectomy and splenectomy, the animals showed a quick recovery from surgery and initial analgetic medication and volume substitution could be terminated within 24 h. A rapid increase in blood glucose was observed immediately following pancreatectomy necessitating insulin therapy. The induced exocrine insufficiency did not cause any clinical symptoms. Complete insulin deficiency could be confirmed in all animals by determination of negative c-peptide during glucose challenge. The two regimen of insulin treatment (multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)) were both feasible with respect to acceptable glycemic control whereas CSII was considerably advantageous in comfort and popularity for both animals and care takers.
Surgical pancreatectomy in combination with splenectomy to facilitate access to the pancreas is a feasible model for efficient diabetes induction in minipigs. The procedure itself and postoperative animal care could be performed without complications in this exploratory study. Nevertheless, this approach requires well-equipped infrastructure, experienced and skilled surgeons and anesthesiologists and dedicated animal care takers. The impact of total pancreatectomy in combination with splenectomy on the digestive and immune system must be considered in the design and definition of end points of experimental diabetes and transplantation studies.

Does Reducing Basal Insulin During Ramadan Fasting by Children and Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes Decrease the Risk of Symptomatic Hypoglycemia?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27500913/),"
Ramadan fasting by patients with type 1 diabetes might predispose them to hypoglycemia. There are no data on the optimal way of adjusting basal insulin during fasting. We aim at studying whether reducing basal insulin during Ramadan reduces the frequency of symptomatic hypoglycemia.
We enrolled children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes who intended to fast during Ramadan. Logbooks were given to subjects to mark days fasted, symptomatic hypoglycemia, and dose of basal insulin on all days of Ramadan. Logbooks were examined. Glucometers and insulin pumps were downloaded.
Seventy-five patients were enrolled. The age was 10.2-18.9 (14.5) years. Sixty-eight patients had results analyzed. Forty-one patients were on pumps, and 27 patients were on multiple daily injections (MDI). Mean HbA1c was 7.9 (1.2) and 8.4 (1.3) for the pump and the MDI, respectively (P = 0.007). Thirty-nine patients had hypoglycemia leading to breaking fast. The mean number of episodes of breaking fast was 3 (1-8). Thirty-five of the 68 patients had reduced basal insulin. The difference in the frequency of hypoglycemia in those who reduced/did not reduce insulin was not statistically significant (P > 0.10). Fifteen patients on MDI and 24 patients on pumps had at least one episode of breaking fast. Six and 18 of the patients on MDI and pumps, respectively, reduced basal insulin (P > 0.10).
This is the first study examining the impact of reduction of basal insulin on hypoglycemia in adolescents. Reducing basal insulin during Ramadan fasting does not decrease the risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia. Use of the insulin pump does not appear to be different from MDI in the frequency of occurrence of hypoglycemia.

Insulin pump therapy in children with type 1 diabetes: analysis of data from the SWEET registry.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27417128/),"
Intensified insulin delivery using multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is recommended in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to achieve good metabolic control.
To examine the frequency of pump usage in T1D children treated in SWEET (Better control in Paediatric and Adolescent diabeteS: Working to crEate CEnTers of Reference) centers and to compare metabolic control between patients treated with CSII vs MDI.
This study included 16 570 T1D children participating in the SWEET prospective, multicenter, standardized diabetes patient registry. Datasets were aggregated over the most recent year of treatment for each patient. Data were collected until March 2016. To assess the organization of pump therapy a survey was carried out.
Overall, 44.4% of T1D children were treated with CSII. The proportion of patients with pump usage varied between centers and decreased with increasing age compared with children treated with MDI. In a logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, gender and diabetes duration, the use of pump was associated with both: center size [odd ratio 1.51 (1.47-1.55), P < .0001) and the diabetes-related expenditure per capita [odd ratio 1.55 (1.49-1.61), P < .0001]. Linear regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender, and diabetes duration showed that both HbA1c and daily insulin dose (U/kg/d) remained decreased in children treated with CSII compared to MDI (P < .0001).
Insulin pump therapy is offered by most Sweet centers. The differences between centers affect the frequency of use of modern technology. Despite the heterogeneity of centers, T1D children achieve relatively good metabolic control, especially those treated with insulin pumps and those of younger age.

The Network of Ontario Pediatric Diabetes Programs was established in 2001 to provide access to specialized pediatric diabetes care. Universal funding for pediatric insulin pump therapy has been available in Ontario since 2006. The objective of this study was to describe the distribution of patients, resources and insulin pump use across centres within the network, now called the Ontario Paediatric Diabetes Network.
We conducted a cross-sectional survey in 2012 of the 35 pediatric diabetes centres in Ontario to measure centre characteristics, patient volume and available clinical and social resources. We used health administrative data from the provincial Assistive Devices Program to describe patients aged 18 years or less using insulin pumps by centre as a measure of technology uptake.
All 35 centres participated, reporting a total of 6676 children with type 1 diabetes and 368 with type 2 diabetes. Most (> 80%) children with type 1 diabetes were followed at tertiary (n = 5) or large community (n = 14) centres. Nursing patient load was similar between centre types, but there was a large range across centres within any type. Overall, percent insulin pump use was 38.1% and varied widely across centres (5.3%-66.7%). Funded 24-hour support for pump users was available at 5 (36%) small community centres, 3 (19%) large community centres and 2 (40%) tertiary centres.
Our study showed differences in access to specialized and after-hours care for children with diabetes in Ontario. Pump use varied widely across centres. Further research is needed to assess the impact of these observed differences on quality of care and outcomes.

Adherence to Insulin Pump Behaviors in Young Children With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27390223/),"
Parents of young children are responsible for daily type 1 diabetes (T1DM) cares including insulin bolusing. For optimal insulin pump management, parents should enter a blood glucose result (SMBG) and a carbohydrate estimate (if food will be consumed) into the bolus advisor in their child's pump to assist in delivering the recommended insulin bolus. Previously, pump adherence behaviors were described in adolescents; we describe these behaviors in a sample of young children.
Pump data covering between 14-30 consecutive days were obtained for 116 children. Assessed adherence to essential pump adherence behaviors (eg, SMBG, carbohydrate entry, and insulin use) and adherence to 3 Wizard/Bolus Advisor steps: SMBG-carbohydrate entry-insulin bolus delivered.
Parents completed SMBG ≥4 times on 99% of days, bolused insulin ≥3 times on 95% of days, and entered carbohydrates ≥3 times on 93% of days, but they corrected for hyperglycemia (≥250 mg/dl or 13.9 mmol/l) only 63% of the time. Parents completed Wizard/Bolus Advisor steps (SMBG, carbohydrate entry, insulin bolus) within 30 minutes for 43% of boluses. Inverse correlations were found between children's mean daily glucose and the percentage of days with ≥4 SMBG and ≥3 carbohydrate entries as well as the percentage of boluses where all Wizard/Bolus Advisor steps were completed.
Parents of young children adhered to individual pump behaviors, but showed some variability in their adherence to Wizard/Bolus Advisor steps. Parents showed low adherence to recommendations to correct for hyperglycemia. Like adolescents, targeting pump behaviors in young children may have the potential to optimize glycemic control.

Possible Radio Interference Between Video Capsule Endoscopy and Second-Generation OmniPod Patch Pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27333334/),"
Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool used to observe the small intestinal mucosa. We report a case of a 57-year-old woman with T2DM, treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using second-generation OmniPod patch pump, undergoing VCE (Given M2A; VCE Ltd, Yoqneam, Israel) for melena and anemia. During VCE, an abnormal interruption of communication between video capsule and its receiver occurred. Two hours after capsule ingestion, the patient activated the insulin pump infusion through the Personal Diabetes Manager (PDM) because she drank a sugary beverage for the first time after ingestion. Due to this, we decided to repeat VCE after the removal of the insulin pump and PDM: at this time, the capsule recorded for more than 10â€‰h without any interruption. The video capsule and second-generation OmniPod patch pump use the same radio frequency and this may cause interference between these two devices. In patients using second-generation OmniPod patch pump undergoing VCE, we suggest to switch to intravenous insulin infusion or multiple daily injection or to use a different model of VCE, as MiRoCam (Intromedic, Seoul, Korea).

Does β-Cell Autoimmunity Play a Role in Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes? Analysis Based on the German/Austrian Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation Registry.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27271187/),"
Research on β-cell autoimmunity in cystic fibrosis (CF)-related diabetes (CFRD) is still rare. We aimed to analyze the frequency of β-cell autoimmunity and the influence on age at diabetes onset, insulin requirement, type of insulin therapy, and hypoglycemic or ketoacidotic events in patients with CFRD compared with antibody-negative patients with CFRD in the Diabetes Patienten Verlaufsdokumentation (DPV) registry.
We analyzed data of 837 patients with CFRD in the German/Austrian DPV database by multivariable mixed-regression modeling.
In our cohort, 8.5% of patients with CFRD (n = 72) were found to be β-cell antibody positive. There was a female preponderance in this patient group: 65.3 vs. 57.6%. Diabetes onset (median [interquartile range]) was earlier (14.00 [10.15-15.90] vs. 16.10 [13.50-21.20] years; P < 0.005), and insulin dose/kg body weight was higher (0.95 [0.61-1.15] vs. 0.67 [0.33-1.04] IU/kg; P < 0.05). There were also differences in the type of insulin treatment. Insulin pump therapy was used significantly more often in patients with CFRD with β-cell autoimmunity (18.2 vs. 6.4%; P < 0.05). The differences for multiple daily injections (ICT) and conventional therapy (CT) were not significant (ICT: 67.7 vs. 79.0%; CT: 15.2 vs. 14.6). Oral antidiabetic agents were rarely used in both groups. Rate of severe hypoglycemia with coma and rate of ketoacidosis were higher in antibody-positive patients (hypoglycemia with coma: 8.0 vs. 1.4, P < 0.05; ketoacidosis: 9.3 vs. 0.9, P < 0.05).
Presence of β-cell autoantibodies in our cohort of patients with CFRD (8.5%) appeared to be greater than in the general population and was associated with female sex, earlier onset of diabetes, and higher insulin requirement. Insulin pump therapy was used significantly more often in patients with β-cell antibodies. Severe hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis were significantly more frequent in CFRD with β-cell autoimmunity compared with β-cell antibody-negative patients with CFRD.

Indications for Insulin Pump Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes and Associations With Glycemic Control.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27226388/),"
Real-world data regarding indications for use of insulin pump remain sparse. We investigated characteristics among individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in relation to indication for use of insulin pump (CSII). Comparison was made with T1D subjects using multiple daily injections (MDI).
We included all individuals with T1D who had at least 1 registration in the National Diabetes Register during 2014-2015. Among 46 874 individuals, we excluded 2350 due to missing data. We examined 35 725 on MDI and 8799 on CSII regarding characteristics in relation to insulin delivery method, as well as association between insulin delivery and glycemic control (HbA1c) and presence of albuminuria.
Unadjusted mean (SD) HbA1c was 63.84 (15.07) mmol/mol (7.99 [1.38]%) and 63.75 (13.19) mmol/mol (7.99 [1.21]%) in the MDI and CSII group, respectively. MDI and CSII users were on average 48.8 and 41.5 years old, respectively. MDI users were on average 26 years old and CSII users 17 years old at the time of diabetes diagnosis. Overall, a higher proportion of CSII users were females (53.5%). As compared with MDI, use of CSII was associated with up to 7.84 mmol/mol (0.72%) lower HbA1c in a multivariable adjusted model. Use of CSII was, however, not associated with risk of having albuminuria.
CSII was used more frequently in younger individuals, early-onset diabetes, and problematic glycemic control. The use of CSII was associated with lower HbA1c among CSII users except from those who started CSII due to high HbA1c.

The role of insulin pump therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27189155/),"
Many patients with type 2 diabetes fail to achieve adequate glucose control despite escalation of treatment and combinations of multiple therapies including insulin. Patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes often suffer from the combination of severe insulin deficiency in addition to insulin resistance, thereby requiring high doses of insulin delivered in multiple injections to attain adequate glycemic control. Insulin-pump therapy was first introduced in the 1970s as an approach to mimic physiological insulin delivery and attain normal glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes. The recent years have seen an increase in the use of this technology for patients with type 2 diabetes. This article summarizes the clinical studies evaluating insulin pump use in patients with type 2 diabetes and discusses the benefits and shortcomings of pump therapy in this population.

The impact of insurance coverage and the family on pediatric diabetes management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27161659/),"
The impact of family composition on glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes remains unclear. We sought to evaluate the relationship between health insurance coverage, family composition, and insulin management, and assess their impact on glycemic control in a pediatric type 1 diabetes population.
A retrospective chart review was completed for patients seen in the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of Louisville in 2012.
The analysis included 729 patients with type 1 diabetes; 268 (37%) had public insurance while 461(63%) had private insurance. Compared with publicly insured patients, privately insured patients had higher rates of intensive insulin management with multiple daily injections (MDI) plans or pump devices (88 vs. 83.2%, p = 0.066) and lower HbA1c levels [8.57 vs. 9.39% (70 vs. 79 mmol/mol), p < 0.001]. Of the 729 patients, 243 were in single-adult homes (33%). Single-adult homes had higher HbA1c levels than two-adult homes, [9.3 vs. 8.6% (78 vs. 70 mmol/mol), p < 0.001]. Among publicly insured, there was no difference in HbA1c levels for single-adult vs. two-adult homes [9.4 (79 mmol/mol), p = 0.868]. For privately insured, patients in single-adult homes had higher HbA1c levels than peers in two-adult homes [9.2 vs. 8.4% (77 vs. 68), p < 0.001].
Insurance type and family composition have significant associative effects on glycemic control and insulin management that may be mitigated by insulin pump therapy. Identifying and addressing factors such as availability of resources, family education, and adult support and supervision, may help improve glycemic control in high-risk pediatric diabetes patients.

Current topics in glycemic control by wearable artificial pancreas or bedside artificial pancreas with closed-loop system.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142278/),"
The incidence of diabetes is increasing at an unprecedented pace and has become a serious health concern worldwide during the last two decades. Despite this, adequate glycemic control using an artificial pancreas has not been established, although the 21st century has seen rapid developments in this area. Herein, we review current topics in glycemic control for both the wearable artificial pancreas for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients and the bedside artificial pancreas for surgical diabetic patients. In type 1 diabetic patients, nocturnal hypoglycemia associated with insulin therapy remains a serious problem that could be addressed by the recent development of a wearable artificial pancreas. This smart phone-like device, comprising a real-time, continuous glucose monitoring system and insulin pump system, could potentially significantly reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia compared with conventional glycemic control. Of particular interest in this space are the recent inventions of a low-glucose suspend feature in the portable systems that automatically stops insulin delivery 2 h following a glucose sensor value <70 mg/dL and a bio-hormonal pump system consisting of insulin and glucagon pumps. Perioperative tight glycemic control using a bedside artificial pancreas with the closed-loop system has also proved safe and effective for not only avoiding hypoglycemia, but also for reducing blood glucose level variability resulting in good surgical outcomes. We hope that a more sophisticated artificial pancreas with closed-loop system will now be taken up for routine use worldwide, providing enormous relief for patients suffering from uncontrolled hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and/or variability in blood glucose concentrations.

"Depressive Symptoms, Emotion Dysregulation, and Bulimic Symptoms in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes: Varying Interactions at Diagnosis and During Transition to Insulin Pump Therapy.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27137457/),"
This study evaluated the associations between depressive symptoms, emotion dysregulation and bulimic symptoms in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the context of the diagnosis and treatment of T1D. Study participants were 103 youth in 2 distinct groups: newly diagnosed (New) or transitioning to pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]; ""Pump""), who completed questionnaires regarding symptoms of depression, emotion dysregulation, and bulimia. Glycemic control (A1c), height, weight, and questionnaires were evaluated within 10 days of diagnosis (n = 58) or at education/clinic visit before starting insulin utilizing CSII (n = 45). In the newly diagnosed group, only depression accounted for significant variance in bulimia scores (β = .47, P < .01). For the group with disease treatment experience (Pump), but not for the newly diagnosed group (New), greater depressive symptoms and emotion dysregulation were associated with greater bulimic symptoms. Depressive symptoms and emotion dysregulation, an indicator of poor coping/behavioral control, could help explain adoption of disordered eating behaviors in youth with T1D who are transitioning to pump therapy.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for Type 1 diabetes mellitus in children.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27083461/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin pump therapy (CSII or pump therapy) is a well-recognised treatment option for Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in paediatrics. It is especially suited to children because it optimises control by improving flexibility across age-specific lifestyles. The NICE guidelines (2008) recognise that pump therapy is advantageous and that it should be utilised to deliver best practice. In Ireland, the National Clinical Program for Diabetes will increase the availability and uptake of CSII in children and thus more clinicians are likely to encounter children using CSII therapy.
This is a narrative review which discusses the basic principles of pump therapy and focuses on aspects of practical management.
Insulin pump management involves some basic yet important principles which optimise the care of diabetes in children.
This review addresses the principles of insulin pump management in children which all health care professionals involved in caring for the child with diabetes, shoud be familiar with.

Improving Patient Experience With Insulin Infusion Sets: Practical Guidelines and Future Directions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27056594/),"
Insulin infusion sets (IISs) are an essential component of safe and effective insulin pump therapy. Establishing best practices for their use has been impeded by a lack of formal study and limited resources for clinician and patient education. Recent innovations in IIS science promise to change this status quo by increasing awareness of such problems as unexplained hyperglycemia and infusion set occlusion.
In August 2015, a panel of diabetologists and certified diabetes educators from various disciplines was convened to reconsider IIS-related complications of pump therapy, to better characterize infusion set factors affecting patient experience, and to update priorities for optimizing current technologies. Actionable guidelines were provided for addressing common issues, including skin reactions, site rotation and set changes, dislodgment of the infusion set, and partial or complete blockage of the catheter. These issues may underlie episodes of IIS failure and/or unexplained hyperglycemia.
Development of practical tools and standardized guidelines for empowering patients to prevent, diagnose, and troubleshoot IIS problems that contribute to unexplained hyperglycemia will be necessary to realize the full benefit of insulin pump therapy along the continuum of diabetes education.

Insulin Pump Malfunction During Hospitalization: Two Case Reports.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27027151/),"
Insulin pump malfunctions and failures continue to occur; however, more severe malfunctions such as the ""runaway pump"" phenomenon are rarely reported. This article describes two cases of pump malfunction in which pump users appear to have received an unsolicited bolus of insulin resulting in severe episodes of hypoglycemia during hospitalization.
Both cases of insulin pump malfunction occurred in the inpatient setting at a large academic medical center in the United States. An analysis of the corresponding insulin pump downloads was performed. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database was searched for similar cases involving Medtronic (Northridge, CA) insulin pumps using the terms ""pump,"" ""infusion,"" ""insulin AND malfunction AND Medtronic.""
The two cases described show remarkable similarities, each demonstrating a severe hypoglycemic event preceded by an infusion site change followed by an alarm. In both cases a rapid spraying of insulin was reported. The insulin pump downloads validated much of the patients' and medical staff's descriptions of events. The FDA's MAUDE database search revealed 425 cases meeting our search term criteria. All cases were reviewed. Seven cases were identified involving independent movement of the reservoir piston.
The cases detailed are the first to describe an insulin pump malfunction of this nature in the hospital setting involving unsolicited insulin boluses leading to severe hypoglycemia. The cases are particularly compelling in that they were witnessed by medical personnel. Providers and patients should receive instruction education on the recognition and management of insulin pump malfunction.

Prevalence of Insulin Pump Therapy and Its Association with Measures of Glycemic Control: Results from the Canadian Study of Longevity in Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27023749/),"
We aimed to determine cross-sectional insulin pump prevalence and factors associated with measures of glycemic control as a secondary analysis in a long-standing type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) national cohort.
Canadian participants with ≥50 years of T1DM (n = 305) were administered a comprehensive mail-based questionnaire including acquisition of contemporaneous laboratory results. Factors associated with pump use, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and hypoglycemia were analyzed by regression.
The 305 participants had a median age of 65 [interquartile range, 59, 71] years, median diabetes duration of 54 [51, 59] years, and mean HbA1c level of 7.5 ± 1.1%. Prevalence of pump use was 44% (133/305), with median duration of use 8 [4, 13] years. Compared with the non-pump subgroup, the pump subgroup had numerically lower but similar HbA1c levels (7.4 ± 0.9% vs. 7.6 ± 1.2%; P = 0.22) and reported greater numbers of minor hypoglycemia events (6.5 vs. 5.1 events/patient·month; P = 0.004) and fewer severe hypoglycemia events (0.5 vs. 1.3 events/patient·year; P = 0.02) in the past year. More frequent daily glucose tests and more frequent minor hypoglycemia events-but not pump therapy or its prescription parameters-were independently associated with lower HbA1c level in multivariable regression. However, use of insulin pump and habitual use of continuous glucose monitoring (≥1 week/month) were each independently associated with lower risk of severe hypoglycemia (risk ratio = 0.50 [P < 0.0001] and 0.30 [P = 0.001], respectively).
Insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring technologies were associated with lower risk of severe hypoglycemia, while frequent daily glucose testing was associated with lower HbA1c level. These findings imply that basic self-management skill and technology play complementary roles in glycemic control among older adults with long-standing T1DM.

Influences on Technology Use and Efficacy in Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27022096/),"
The majority of people with type 1 diabetes have suboptimal glycemic control, increasing their complication risk. Technology to support diabetes self-care has advanced significantly and includes self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), insulin pump therapy (IPT), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), and sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT), which are stepping stones toward the ""artificial pancreas"" using closed-loop technology. Use of these technologies improves clinical outcomes for patients with the appropriate skills and motivation. This review addresses the psychosocial factors that influence both technology provision and clinical outcome and also how technology impacts on psychological outcomes. Optimal use of the various diabetes self-management technologies is influenced by previous self-care behaviors, demographic and psychological factors. Provision of IPT is also influenced by the same factors. Despite technology increasing the complexity of treatment, the lack of evidence for adverse psychological outcomes is reassuring. Treatment satisfaction is high, and discontinuation rates are low. However, technology will widen the health inequality gap if its use is limited to motivated patients who demonstrate good self-care behaviors. Pivotal to the success of the various technologies is provision of appropriate education at initiation of the technology, regular ongoing contact for treatment adjustments and trouble-shooting device issues plus access to psychological support when required. Additional support strategies may be required to help patients struggling with their diabetes to benefit from the available technology, recognizing that they may have most to gain.

Performance and safety of an integrated bihormonal artificial pancreas for fully automated glucose control at home.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26996542/),"
To assess the performance and safety of an integrated bihormonal artificial pancreas system consisting of one wearable device and two wireless glucose sensor transmitters during short-term daily use at home.
Adult patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump were invited to enrol in this randomized crossover study. Treatment with the artificial pancreas started with a day and night in the clinical research centre, followed by 3 days at home. The control period consisted of 4 days of insulin pump therapy at home with blinded continuous glucose monitoring for data collection. Days 2-4 were predefined as the analysis period, with median glucose as the primary outcome.
A total of 10 patients completed the study. The median [interquartile range (IQR)] glucose level was similar for the two treatments [7.3 (7.0-7.6) mmol/l for the artificial pancreas vs. 7.7 (7.0-9.0) mmol/l for the control; p = 0.123]. The median (IQR) percentage of time spent in euglycaemia (3.9-10 mmol/l) was longer during use of the artificial pancreas [84.7 (82.2-87.8)% for the artificial pancreas vs. 68.5 (57.9-83.6)% for the control; p = 0.007]. Time in hypoglycaemia was 1.3 (0.2-3.2)% for the artificial pancreas and 2.4 (0.4-10.3)% for the control treatment (p = 0.139). Separate analysis of daytime and night-time showed that the improvements were mainly achieved during the night.
The results of this pilot study suggest that our integrated artificial pancreas provides better glucose control than insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes at home and that the treatment is safe.

Insulin pump use compared with intravenous insulin during labour and delivery: the INSPIRED observational cohort study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26927202/),"
To assess the safety and efficacy of pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; CSII) during labour and delivery in women with Type 1 diabetes.
A retrospective cohort study of 161 consecutive Type 1 diabetic pregnancies delivered during 2000-2010 at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada. Capillary blood glucose levels during labour and delivery and time in/out of target (target: 4-6 mmol/l) were compared along with neonatal outcomes for three groups: (1) women on pumps who stayed on pumps during labour (pump/pump n = 31), (2) women on pumps who switched to intravenous (IV) insulin infusion during labour (pump/IVn = 25), and (3) women on multiple daily injections who switched to IV insulin infusion during labour (MDIn = 105).
There were no significant differences between the mean or median glucose values during labour and delivery across all three groups, and no significant difference in time spent hypoglycaemic. However, women in the pump/pump group had significantly better glycaemic control as defined by mean glucose (5.5 vs. 6.4 mmol/l; P = 0.01), median glucose (5.4 vs. 6.3 mmol/l; P = 0.02), and more time spent in target (60.9% vs. 39.2%; P = 0.06) compared with women in the pump/IV group (after removing one outlier).
This study demonstrates that the continuation of CSII therapy during labour and delivery appears safe and efficacious. Moreover, women who choose to continue CSII have better glucose control during delivery than those who switch to IV insulin, suggesting that it should be standard practice to allow women the option of continuing CSII during labour and delivery.

Using technology to advance type 1 diabetes care among women during the reproductive years and in pregnancy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26924774/),"
The prevalence of diabetes is increasing globally. Technology to improve care among individuals with diabetes is constantly being developed. Women living with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) have unique challenges affecting their glucose control relating to menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause. The purpose of this review is to examine the literature related to the use of technology to help women with T1DM manage their diabetes during the reproductive years, pregnancy, and beyond. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy can provider equivalent or better glucose control when compared with multiple daily injections (MDI), with less hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and weight gain. The CSII therapy has features that could help improve glucose control over the menstrual cycle, menopause, and pregnancy, although the most studied of these stages is pregnancy. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be combined with any insulin delivery system (MDI or CSII) to provide data on glucose values every few minutes and show glucose trends over time. CGM introduction can highlight glucose variability for women with T1DM, may be beneficial during pregnancy, and can reduce hypoglycemia. Sensor-augmented pump therapy and hybrid artificial pancreas (closed-loop) systems are promising tools that improve outcomes among individuals with diabetes. The use of modern technology to improve glucose and metabolic control among menopausal women with diabetes has not been well studied. Internet and phone-based technologies are emerging as important tools that may help with diabetes self-care for women living with diabetes.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring Adherence: Lessons From a Clinical Trial to Predict Outpatient Behavior.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26908570/),"
This study reports continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) adherence patterns and contributing factors in patients who were part of a 6-month clinical trial using sensor augmented pump therapy with low glucose insulin suspension.
CGM data from 38 patients using sensor augmented pump therapy for 6 months were analyzed. CGM adherence was defined by having a working sensor available and determined by the time it was switched on as a proportion of available time for the 6 month study period with allowance for practical CGM use. Age, gender, HbA1c, duration of diagnosis, capillary blood glucose testing frequency, sensor accuracy, and insulin pump alarm frequency were characterized and examined for an association with CGM adherence.
Overall CGM adherence was 75% (range: 35% to 96%), CGM adherence was demonstrated to fall after 9 to 11 weeks before reaching a steady rate. CGM adherence patterns showed substantial variation. Mean adherence differed (P < .01) between age groups 72% (<12 years), 69% (12-18 years), and 88% (≥18 years). Sensor accuracy predicted adherence, where every 1% decline in mean absolute difference in a given week was associated with a 0.5% decline in sensor adherence (P < .01). Gender, HbA1c, duration of diagnosis, capillary blood glucose testing frequency, and insulin pump alarm frequency were not associated with CGM adherence.
CGM adherence and patterns of use are individualized. However, a predictable fall in adherence at 9 to 11 weeks may present an opportunity for timed interventions to increase CGM use. Adolescent age and sensor accuracy predict CGM adherence.

Hypoglycemia Prevention and User Acceptance of an Insulin Pump System with Predictive Low Glucose Management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26907513/),"
The MiniMed 640G sensor-augmented insulin pump system (Medtronic, Inc., Northridge, CA) can automatically suspend insulin delivery in advance of predicted hypoglycemia and restart it upon recovery. The aims of this analysis were to determine the rate at which predicted hypoglycemia was avoided with this strategy, as well as to assess user acceptance of the system and its insulin management features.
Forty subjects with type 1 diabetes used the system for 4 weeks. We retrospectively evaluated performance of the system, using downloaded pump and sensor data, and evaluated user acceptance via questionnaires.
There were 2,322 suspend before low events (2.1 per subject-day). The mean (± SD) duration of pump suspension events was 56.4 ± 9.6 min, and the mean subsequent sensor glucose (SG) nadir was 71.8 ± 5.2 mg/dL. SG values following 1,930 (83.1%) of the predictive suspensions did not reach the preset low limit. Nadir SG values of ≤50 and ≤60 mg/dL were seen in 207 (8.9%) and 356 (15.3%) of the predictive suspensions, respectively. Blood glucose (BG) and SG values before and during the study were comparable (P > 0.05). The mean absolute relative difference between paired SG and BG values was 10.9 ± 13.8%. Subjects felt confident using the system, agreed that it helped protect them from hypoglycemia, and wished to continue using it.
Automatic insulin pump suspension as implemented in the MiniMed 640G system can help patients avoid hypoglycemia, without significantly increasing hyperglycemia.

The Impact of Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Therapy on Efficacy and Safety in a Cohort of Type 1 Diabetes Patients: A 3-Year Prospective Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26862678/),"
Several studies have found improved glycemic control with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared with multiple daily insulin injections for patients with type 1 diabetes, albeit for a relatively short-period of follow-up. This prospective study presents for the first time the optimization of glycemic control with insulin pumps in a cohort of Greek patients with type 1 diabetes for a 3-year follow-up period during the socioeconomic crisis in Greece.
Ninety-four patients, previously on intensified basal-bolus insulin therapy with poor glycemic control, were initially recruited. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hypoglycemic and diabetic ketoacidosis episodes, pump-related side effects, lipidemic profile, 24-h urine albumin excretion, body mass index, blood pressure, and total daily insulin requirements (bolus and basal) were recorded during the 3-year follow-up. Statistical analysis was initially conducted for the entire study population and after body mass index and gender stratification.
Seventy-nine patients completed the study. A statistically significant decrease of HbA1c level (P < 0.0001) was observed at the end of Year 1 and was retained for the following years for the whole population. Similarly, significantly fewer hypoglycemic episodes occurred during the follow-up period (P < 0.0001) compared with study entry. Insulin pump treatment was not accompanied with weight changes across all body mass index strata.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion achieved almost optimal glycemic control, reduced the number of hypoglycemic episodes without weight gain, and was well tolerated for the whole study period. Finally, this therapeutic approach was accompanied with lower daily insulin requirements.

To compare insulin pump therapy and multiple daily injections (MDI) in patients with type 2 diabetes receiving basal and prandial insulin analogues.
After a 2-month dose-optimization period, 331 patients with glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels ≥8.0% and ≤12% were randomized to pump therapy or continued MDI for 6 months [randomization phase (RP)]. The MDI group was subsequently switched to pump therapy during a 6-month continuation phase (CP). The primary endpoint was the between-group difference in change in mean HbA1c from baseline to the end of the RP.
The mean HbA1c at baseline was 9% in both groups. At the end of the RP, the reduction in HbA1c was significantly greater with pump therapy than with MDI (-1.1 ± 1.2% vs -0.4 ± 1.1%; p < 0.001). The pump therapy group maintained this improvement to 12 months while the MDI group, which was switched to pump therapy, showed a 0.8% reduction: the final HbA1c level was identical in both arms. In the RP, total daily insulin dose (TDD) was 20.4% lower with pump therapy than with MDI and remained stable in the CP. The MDI-pump group showed a 19% decline in TDD, such that by 12 months TDD was equivalent in both groups. There were no differences in weight gain or ketoacidosis between groups. In the CP, one patient in each group experienced severe hypoglycaemia.

Day and night glycaemic control with a bionic pancreas versus conventional insulin pump therapy in preadolescent children with type 1 diabetes: a randomised crossover trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26850709/),"
The safety and efficacy of continuous, multiday, automated glycaemic management has not been tested in outpatient studies of preadolescent children with type 1 diabetes. We aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of a bihormonal bionic pancreas versus conventional insulin pump therapy in this population of patients in an outpatient setting.
In this randomised, open-label, crossover study, we enrolled preadolescent children (aged 6-11 years) with type 1 diabetes (diagnosed for ≥1 year) who were on insulin pump therapy, from two diabetes camps in the USA. With the use of sealed envelopes, participants were randomly assigned in blocks of two to either 5 days with the bionic pancreas or conventional insulin pump therapy (control) as the first intervention, followed by a 3 day washout period and then 5 days with the other intervention. Study allocation was not masked. The autonomously adaptive algorithm of the bionic pancreas received data from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device to control subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon. Conventional insulin pump therapy was administered by the camp physicians and other clinical staff in accordance with their established protocols; participants also wore a CGM device during the control period. The coprimary outcomes, analysed by intention to treat, were mean CGM-measured glucose concentration and the proportion of time with a CGM-measured glucose concentration below 3·3 mmol/L, on days 2-5. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02105324.
Between July 20, and Aug 19, 2014, 19 children with a mean age of 9·8 years (SD 1·6) participated in and completed the study. The bionic pancreas period was associated with a lower mean CGM-measured glucose concentration on days 2-5 than was the control period (7·6 mmol/L [SD 0·6] vs 9·3 mmol/L [1·7]; p=0·00037) and a lower proportion of time with a CGM-measured glucose concentration below 3·3 mmol/L on days 2-5 (1·2% [SD 1·1] vs 2·8% [1·2]; p<0·0001). The median number of carbohydrate interventions given per participant for hypoglycaemia on days 1-5 (ie, glucose <3·9 mmol/L) was lower during the bionic pancreas period than during the control period (three [range 0-8] vs five [0-14]; p=0·037). No episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were recorded. Medium-to-large concentrations of ketones (range 0·6-3·6 mmol/dL) were reported on seven occasions in five participants during the control period and on no occasion during the bionic pancreas period (p=0·063).
The improved mean glycaemia and reduced hypoglycaemia with the bionic pancreas relative to insulin pump therapy in preadolescent children with type 1 diabetes in a diabetes camp setting is a promising finding. Studies of a longer duration during which children use the bionic pancreas during their normal routines at home and school should be done to investigate the potential for use of the bionic pancreas in real-world settings.

Successful treatment of young infants presenting neonatal diabetes mellitus with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion before genetic diagnosis.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26831749/),"
Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is defined as hyperglycemia and impaired insulin secretion with onset within 6 months of birth. While rare, NDM presents complex challenges regarding the management of glycemic control. The availability of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps (CSII) in combination with continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGM) provides an opportunity to monitor glucose levels more closely and deliver insulin more safely.
We report four cases of young infants with NDM successfully treated with CSII and CGM. Moreover, in two cases with Kir 6.2 mutation, we describe the use of CSII in switching therapy from insulin to sulfonylurea treatment.
Insulin pump requirement for the 4 neonatal diabetes cases was the same regardless of disease pathogenesis and c-peptide levels. No dilution of insulin was needed. The use of an integrated CGM system helped in a more precise control of BG levels with the possibility of several modifications of insulin basal rates. Moreover, as showed in the first two case-reports, when the treatment was switched from insulin to glibenclamide, according to identification of Kir 6.2 mutation and diagnosis of NPDM, the CSII therapy demonstrated to be helpful in allowing gradual insulin suspension and progressive introduction of sulfonylurea.
During the neonatal period, the use of CSII therapy is safe, more physiological, accurate and easier for the insulin administration management. Furthermore, CSII therapy is safe during the switch of therapy from insulin to glibenclamide for infants with permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.

The aim of this study was to determine if early initiation of IPT in children with type 1 diabetes leads to improved glycaemic control and quality of life (QOL) compared with the later introduction of IPT.
There were 38 subjects in the early pump group (EPG) (age 12.6 + 4.9 yr, 23 male) and 37 in the later pump group (LPG) (age 13.1 + 4.1 yr, 19 male).
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), rate of severe hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) were collected retrospectively over a 48-month period. Eligible subjects and/or their parents completed both a Paediatric and Paediatric Diabetes-specific Quality of Life Inventory.
HbA1c measurements were lower in the EPG (6.8%; 51 mmol/mol) compared to the LPG (7.9%; 63 mmol/mol), across the 48 months of the study (p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the rate (per patient years) of severe hypoglycaemia (0.02; 0.07) p = 0.075 between the two groups. There were no episodes of DKA in either group. There was no significant difference in QOL between the groups with both having high satisfaction rates.
Initiation of IPT at diagnosis of type 1 diabetes in children resulted in consistently lower HbA1c with no apparent change in hypoglycemia, DKA, or QOL.

Optimum bolus wizard settings in insulin pumps in children with Type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26773826/),"
To evaluate current insulin pump settings in an optimally regulated paediatric population using bolus wizard.
We used a retrospective study design to analyse data from 124 children on insulin pump therapy who had optimum HbA1c levels [< 59 mmol/mol (< 7.5%)] and no history of severe hypoglycaemic events. Bolus wizard settings were used to calculate the insulin to carbohydrate factors and insulin sensitivity factors. Multiple regression analysis was used to analyse the variables associated with the calculation factors.
Insulin to carbohydrate factor varied from 276 in the youngest group to 424 in the oldest group, and increased according to age. Insulin sensitivity factor was highest in the group aged 6 to < 12 years, with a value of 125. Age, amount of carbohydrates, number of boluses per day and insulin per kg were all significantly associated with both calculation factors. Furthermore, duration of insulin pump treatment was significantly associated with insulin sensitivity factor and percentage bolus/basal was significantly associated with insulin to carbohydrate factor. Gender, diabetes duration and BMI were not associated with any of the calculation factors.
Optimum insulin pump settings at pump initiation depend on both insulin requirements and use of the pump. Settings need to be individualized because the standardized calculation factors are not constant for children. There is a need to develop specific age- and insulin dose-dependent calculation factors.

"Insulin pump use and discontinuation in children and teens: a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26748950/),"
To describe insulin pump use by youth since introduction of universal funding in Ontario, Canada and to explore the relationship between pump use and pediatric diabetes center characteristics and the relationship between discontinuation and center and patient characteristics.
Observational, population-based cohort study of youth with type 1 diabetes (<19 yr) who received pump funding from 2006 to 2013 (n = 3700). We linked 2012 survey data from 33 pediatric diabetes centers to health administrative databases. We tested the relationship between center-level pump uptake and center characteristics (center type, physician model, and availability of 24-h support) using an adjusted negative binomial model; we studied center- and patient-level factors (socioeconomic status and baseline glycemic control) associated with discontinuation using a Cox proportional hazards model with generalized estimating equations.
Pump users were more likely to be in the highest income quintile than non-pump users (29.6 vs. 19.1%, p < 0.0001). In 2012, mean percent pump use was 38.0% with variability across centers. There was no association between uptake and center characteristics. Discontinuation was low (0.42/100 person-yr) and was associated with being followed at a small community center [hazard ratio (HR): 2.24 (1.05-4.76)] and being more deprived [HR: 2.36 (1.14-1.48)]. Older age was associated with a lower rate of discontinuation [HR: 0.31 (0.14-0.66)].
Rates of pump use have increased since 2006 and discontinuation is rare. Large variation in uptake across centers was not explained by the factors we examined but may reflect variation in patient populations or practice patterns, and should be further explored.

White Coat Adherence in Pediatric Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Who Use Insulin Pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26746686/),"
The purpose was to assess the occurrence of white coat adherence, defined as an increase in adherence to treatment regimens prior to a clinic appointment, in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who use insulin pumps.
Blood glucose monitoring (BGM) data, carbohydrate inputs, and insulin boluses delivered were downloaded from the insulin pumps of children and adolescents, aged 7-19 years with T1D, at 2 consecutive routine diabetes clinic visits. Linear mixed models were used to analyze patterns of BGM, carbohydrate inputs, and insulin boluses delivered in patients who had ≥28 days of data stored in their insulin pumps.
In general, younger children engaged in more frequent BGM, carbohydrate inputs, and insulin boluses delivered than older children and adolescents. White coat adherence occurred with frequency of BGM, carbohydrate inputs, and insulin boluses delivered, but only in younger children.
Diabetes care providers need to be aware that white coat adherence may occur, particularly in young children. Providers routinely download meter and insulin pump data for the 1- to 2-week period before the clinic visit. For patients exhibiting white coat adherence, their data will overestimate the patient's actual adherence.

Adaptability of structured forms for CSII initiation in patients with type 2 diabetes the Getting2Goal(SM) concept.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26746672/),"
The goal is to assess the usability and satisfaction of implementing the Getting2Goal(SM) protocol by physicians transitioning patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) from multiple daily injections (MDI) to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
T2DM patients from three diabetes clinics were switched from MDI to CSII. Physicians used the Getting2Goal type 2 pumping protocol to prescribe and manage insulin pump therapy for T2DM. Surveys were conducted in which the physicians rated their feedback related to acceptability of the Getting2Goal on a 5-point Likert scale.
17 patients with T2DM were switched from MDI to CSII treatment. Mean (±standard deviation) age was 61.2 ± 7.7 (46-77) years, weight was 91.4 ± 21 (66-147) kg, BMI was 31.9 ± 7.6, A1C was 9.2 ± 1.4 % (7.2-12.3) and TDD on MDI was 109.1 ± 53.1 units. Surveys completed by physicians indicated Getting2Goal type 2 pumping protocol to be more efficient, time saving, and structured compared to their current processes. In addition, the primarily prescribed TDD on pump was 98.1 ± 50.0 units and the TDD at first download was 81.4 ± 36.4 units, representing a 25.4 % reduction in TDD At first download. The percentage of all blood glucose readings below 70 mg/dL was also very low.
The data indicate Getting2Goal materials as a standard approach that is simple and efficient to initiate pump therapy for T2DM. At the same time, it is safe and a useful tool for physicians that are starting to prescribe pump therapy for T2DM.

An Overview of Insulin Pumps and Glucose Sensors for the Generalist.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26742082/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin, or the insulin pump, has gained popularity and sophistication as a near-physiologic programmable method of insulin delivery that is flexible and lifestyle-friendly. The introduction of continuous monitoring with glucose sensors provides unprecedented access to, and prediction of, a patient's blood glucose levels. Efforts are underway to integrate the two technologies, from ""sensor-augmented"" and ""sensor-driven"" pumps to a fully-automated and independent sensing-and-delivery system. Implantable pumps and an early-phase ""bionic pancreas"" are also in active development. Fine-tuned ""pancreas replacement"" promises to be one of the many avenues that offers hope for individuals suffering from diabetes. Although endocrinologists and diabetes specialists will continue to maintain expertise in this field, it behooves the primary care physician to have a working knowledge of insulin pumps and sensors to ensure optimal clinical care and decision-making for their patients.

"Day-and-Night Hybrid Closed-Loop Insulin Delivery in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes: A Free-Living, Randomized Clinical Trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26740634/),"
To evaluate feasibility, safety, and efficacy of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery in adolescents with type 1 diabetes under free-living conditions without remote monitoring or supervision.
In an open-label, randomized, free-living, crossover study design, 12 adolescents receiving insulin pump therapy (mean [±SD] age 15.4 ± 2.6 years; HbA1c 8.3 ± 0.9%; duration of diabetes 8.2 ± 3.4 years) underwent two 7-day periods of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy or hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery without supervision or remote monitoring. During the closed-loop insulin delivery, a model predictive algorithm automatically directed insulin delivery between meals and overnight; prandial boluses were administered by participants using a bolus calculator.
The proportion of time when the sensor glucose level was in the target range (3.9-10 mmol/L) was increased during closed-loop insulin delivery compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy (72 vs. 53%, P < 0.001; primary end point), the mean glucose concentration was lowered (8.7 vs. 10.1 mmol/L, P = 0.028), and the time spent above the target level was reduced (P = 0.005) without changing the total daily insulin amount (P = 0.55). The time spent in the hypoglycemic range was low and comparable between interventions.
Unsupervised day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery at home is feasible and safe in young people with type 1 diabetes. Compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, closed-loop insulin delivery may improve glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia in adolescents with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes.

Use of Commonly Available Technologies for Diabetes Information and Self-Management Among Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes and Their Parents: A Web-Based Survey Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26715191/),"
For individuals with Type 1 diabetes (T1D), following a complicated daily medical regimen is critical to maintaining optimal health. Adolescents in particular struggle with regimen adherence. Commonly available technologies (eg, diabetes websites, apps) can provide diabetes-related support, yet little is known about how many adolescents with T1D use them, why they are used, or relationships between use and self-management.
This study examined adolescent and parent use of 5 commonly available technologies for diabetes, including proportions who use each technology, frequency of use, and number of different technologies used for diabetes. Analyses also investigated the reasons adolescents reported for using or not using technologies for diabetes, and factors correlated with adolescents' technology use. Finally, this study examined relationships between the type and number of technologies adolescents use for diabetes and their self-management and glycemic control.
Adolescents (12-17 years) and their parents (N=174 pairs), recruited from a pediatric diabetes clinic (n=134) and the Children with Diabetes community website (n=40), participated in this Web-based survey study. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) values were obtained from medical records for pediatric clinic patients. Adolescents reported their use of 5 commonly available technologies for diabetes (ie, social networking, diabetes websites, mobile diabetes apps, text messaging, and glucometer/insulin pump software), reasons for use, and self-management behavior (Self-Care Inventory-Revised, SCI-R).
Most adolescents and parents used at least one of the 5 technologies for diabetes. Among adolescents, the most commonly used technology for diabetes was text messaging (53%), and the least commonly used was diabetes websites (25%). Most adolescents who used diabetes apps, text messaging, or pump/glucometer software did so more frequently (≥2 times per week), compared to social networking and website use (≤1 time per week). The demographic, clinical, and parent-technology use factors related to adolescents' technology use varied by technology. Adolescents who used social networking, websites, or pump/glucometer software for diabetes had better self-management behavior (SCI-R scores: beta=.18, P=.02; beta=.15, P=.046; beta=.15, P=.04, respectively), as did those who used several technologies for diabetes (beta=.23, P=.003). However, use of diabetes websites was related to poorer glycemic control (A1C: beta=.18, P=.01).
Adolescents with T1D may be drawn to different technologies for different purposes, as individual technologies likely offer differing forms of support for diabetes self-management (eg, tracking blood glucose or aiding problem solving). Findings suggest that technologies that are especially useful for adolescents' diabetes problem solving may be particularly beneficial for their self-management. Additional research should examine relationships between the nature of technology use and adolescents' T1D self-management over time.

Evaluation of a novel continuous glucose monitoring guided system for adjustment of insulin dosing - PumpTune: a randomized controlled trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26701831/),"
Retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can guide insulin pump adjustments, however, interpretation of data and recommending new pump settings is complex and subjective. We aimed to compare the safety and glycaemic profiles of children after their diabetologist or a novel algorithm (PumpTune) adjusted their insulin pump settings.
In a randomized cross-over trial of 22 patients aged 6-14 yr with type 1 diabetes with mean Hba1c 7.4% (57 mmol/mol) using CSII, CGM was used over two periods each of 6.5 d to assess percentage time glucose remained within, above and below 3.9-10.0 mmol/L. Before the start of one period pump settings were adjusted by the patient's diabetologist, and before the other insulin pump settings were adjusted by PumpTune.
A total of 63.4% of the sensor glucose levels were within target range with PumpTune settings and 57.4% were within range with the clinician settings (p = 0.016). The time spent above target range with PumpTune was 26.9% and with clinician settings was 33.5% (p = 0.021). The time spent below target range with PumpTune was 9.7% and with clinician settings was 9.2% (p = 0.77). The mean number of times when a sensor glucose level <2.75 mmol/L was recorded with PumpTune settings was 2.9 compared with 3.7 with clinician settings (p = 0.39). There were no serious adverse outcomes and no difference in parent-assessed satisfaction.
Automated insulin pump adjustment with PumpTune is feasible and warrants testing in a larger more varied population over a longer time. In this well-controlled group of children, PumpTune achieved a more favorable glucose profile.

Successful Application of Closed-Loop Artificial Pancreas Therapy After Islet Autotransplantation.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26588810/),"
Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TPIAT) may relieve the pain of chronic pancreatitis while avoiding postsurgical diabetes. Minimizing hyperglycemia after TPIAT limits beta cell apoptosis during islet engraftment. Closed-loop (CL) therapy combining an insulin pump with a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) has not been investigated previously in islet transplant recipients. Our objective was to determine the feasibility and efficacy of CL therapy to maintain glucose profiles close to normoglycemia following TPIAT. Fourteen adult subjects (36% male; aged 35.9 ± 11.4 years) were randomized to subcutaneous insulin via CL pump (n = 7) or multiple daily injections with blinded CGM (n = 7) for 72 h at transition from intravenous to subcutaneous insulin. Mean serum glucose values were significantly lower in the CL pump group than in the control group (111 ± 4 vs. 130 ± 13 mg/dL; p = 0.003) without increased risk of hypoglycemia (percentage of time <70 mg/dL: CL pump 1.9%, control 4.8%; p = 0.46). Results from this pilot study suggest that CL therapy is superior to conventional therapy in maintaining euglycemia without increased hypoglycemia. This technology shows significant promise to safely maintain euglycemic targets during the period of islet engraftment following islet transplantation.

Valuing technology: A qualitative interview study with physicians about insulin pump therapy for children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26563632/),"
Insulin pumps for children with type 1 diabetes have been broadly adopted despite equivocal evidence about comparative effectiveness. To understand why and inform policy related to public funding for new technologies, we explored how physicians interpret the value of pumps. We conducted open-ended, semi-structured interviews with 16 physicians from a pediatric diabetes network in Ontario, Canada, and analyzed the data using interpretive description. Respondents recognized that pumps fell short of expectations because they required hard work, as well as family and school support. Yet, pumps were valued for their status as new technologies and as a promising step in developing future technology. In addition, they were valued for their role within a therapeutic relationship, given the context of chronic childhood disease. These findings identify the types of beliefs that influence the adoption and diffusion of technologies. Some beliefs bear on hopes for new technology that may inappropriately hasten adoption, creating excess cost with little benefit. On the other hand, some beliefs identify potential benefits that are not captured in effectiveness studies, but may warrant consideration in resource allocation decisions. Still others suggest the need for remediation, such as those bearing on disparity in pump use by socioeconomic status. Understanding how technologies are valued can help stakeholders decide how to address such beliefs and expectations in funding decisions and implementation protocols.

Moving toward the ideal insulin for insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26560137/),"
Advances in insulin formulations have been important for diabetes management and achieving optimal glycemic control. Rapid-acting insulin analogs provide a faster time-action profile than regular insulin and are approved for use in pumps. However, the need remains for therapy to deliver a more physiologic insulin profile. New insulin formulations and delivery methods are in development, with the aim of accelerating insulin absorption to accomplish ultra-fast-acting insulin time-action profiles. Furthermore, the integration of continuous glucose monitoring with insulin pump therapy enables on-going adjustment of insulin delivery to optimize glycemic control throughout the day and night. These technological and pharmacological advances are likely to facilitate the development of closed-loop pump systems (i.e., artificial pancreas), and improve glycemic control and quality of life for patients with diabetes.

"Use of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and its impact on metabolic control: comparison of results from three large, transatlantic paediatric registries.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26546085/),"
While the use of insulin pumps in paediatrics has expanded dramatically, there is still considerable variability among countries in the use of pump technology. The present study sought to describe differences in metabolic control and pump use in young people with type 1 diabetes using data collected in three multicentre registries.
Data for the years 2011 and 2012 from 54,410 children and adolescents were collected from the Prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry (DPV; n = 26,198), T1D Exchange (T1DX; n = 13,755) and the National Paediatric Diabetes Audit (NPDA; n = 14,457). The modality of insulin delivery, based on age, sex and ethnic minority status, and the impact of pump use on HbA1c levels were compared.
The overall mean HbA1c level was higher in the NPDA (8.9 ± 1.6% [74 ± 17.5 mmol/mol]) than in the DPV (8.0 ± 1.6% [64 ± 17.0 mmol/mol], p < 0.001) and T1DX (8.3 ± 1.4% [68 ± 15.4 mmol/mol], p < 0.001). Conversely, pump use was much lower in the NPDA (14%) than in the DPV (41%, p < 0.001) and T1DX (47%, p < 0.001). In a pooled analysis, pump use was associated with a lower mean HbA1c (pump: 8.0 ± 1.2% [64 ± 13.3 mmol/mol] vs injection: 8.5 ± 1.7% [69 ± 18.7 mmol/mol], p < 0.001). In all three registries, those with an ethnic minority status were less likely to be treated with a pump (p < 0.001) and boys were treated with a pump less often compared with girls (p < 0.001).
Despite similar clinical characteristics and proportion of minority participants, substantial differences in metabolic control exist across the three large transatlantic registries of paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes, which appears to be due in part to the frequency of insulin pump therapy.

Carbohydrate intake is associated with time spent in the euglycemic range in patients with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26543542/),"
Greater glycemic variability and lack of predictability are important issues for patients with type 1 diabetes. Dietary factors are one of the contributors to this variability, but how closely diet is linked to glycemic fluctuation on a daily basis has not been investigated. We examined the association between carbohydrate intake and glycemic excursion in outpatients.
A total of 33 patients with type 1 diabetes were included in the analyses (age 44.5 ± 14.7 years, diabetes duration 15.1 ± 8.3 years, 64% female, 30% using insulin pump, glycated hemoglobin 8.1 ± 1.3%). Time spent in euglycemia (70-180 mg/dL), hyperglycemia (>180 mg/dL) and hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) of consecutive 48-h periods of continuous glucose monitoring data were collected together with simultaneous records of dietary intake, insulin dose and physical activity. Correlation analyses and multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate the contribution of carbohydrate intake to time spent in the target glycemic range.
In multiple regression analyses, carbohydrate intake (β = 0.53, P = 0.001), basal insulin dose per kg per day (β = -0.31, P = 0.034) and diabetes duration (β = 0.30, P = 0.042) were independent predictors of time spent in euglycemia. Carbohydrate intake (β = -0.51, P = 0.001) and insulin pump use (β = -0.34, P = 0.024) were independent predictors of time spent in hyperglycemia. Insulin pump use (β = 0.52, P < 0.001) and bolus insulin dose per kg per day (β = 0.46, P = 0.001) were independent predictors of time spent in hypoglycemia.

Metabolic control after years of completing a clinical trial on sensor-augmented pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26521155/),"
Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy has been shown to be effective and safe for improving metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in a number of trials. Our objective was to assess glycemic control in a group of T1DM patients on insulin pump or SAP therapy after years of participating in the SWITCH (Sensing With Insulin pump Therapy To Control HbA1c) trial and their return to routine medical monitoring.
A retrospective, observational study of 20 patients who participated in the SWITCH trial at our hospital from 2008 to 2010. HbA1c values were compared at the start, during (at the end of the periods with/without SAP use - Sensor On/Sensor Off period respectively - of the cross-over design), and 3 years after study completion. HbA1c values of patients who continued SAP therapy (n=6) or only used insulin pump (n=14) were also compared.
Twenty patients with T1DM (44.4±9.3 years, 60% women, baseline HbA1c level 8.43±0.55%) were enrolled into the SWITCH study). Three years after study completion, HbA1c level was 7.79±0.77 in patients on pump alone, with no significant change from the value at the end of the Off period of the study (7.85±0.57%; p=0.961). As compared to the end of the On period, HbA1c worsened less in patients who remained on SAP than in those on pump alone (0.18±0.42 vs. 0.55±0.71%; p=0.171), despite the fact that levels were similar at study start (8.41±0.60 vs. 8.47±0.45; p=0.831) and at the end of the On period (7.24±0.48 vs. 7.38±0.61; p=0.566). Frequency of CGM use in patients who continued SAP therapy was high (61.2% of the time in the last 3 months).
Our study suggests that the additional benefit of SAP therapy achieved in a clinical trial may persist in the long term in routine clinical care of patients with T1DM.

To identify the knowledge and management factors associated with glycaemic control among adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin pump therapy.
A cross-sectional study of adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin pump therapy for at least 12 months (n = 50, 18-70 years old) was undertaken between December 2013 and May 2014. A new questionnaire was developed to evaluate participants' knowledge and management related to insulin pump therapy, and were correlated with insulin pump data, HbA1c and frequency of hypoglycaemia.
Participants who changed their insulin pump settings when indicated had significantly better glycaemic control than those who did not (P = 0.04). Multivariate logistic regression analysis found that better overall insulin pump therapy management was a significant predictor of better glycaemic control (odds ratio 4.45, 95% confidence interval 1.61-12.3; P = 0.004) after adjusting for potential confounders including age, gender, duration of diabetes and insulin pump therapy. However, overall insulin pump therapy knowledge was not a significant predictor of glycaemic control (P = 0.058). There was no significant association between frequency of hypoglycaemia and insulin pump therapy knowledge or management.
We identified some key knowledge and management factors associated with glycaemic control in adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin pump therapy using a newly designed questionnaire. The pilot study assessed the clinical utility of this evaluation tool, which may facilitate provision of targeted education to insulin pump therapy users to achieve optimal glycaemic control.

2 month evening and night closed-loop glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes under free-living conditions: a randomised crossover trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26432775/),"
An artificial pancreas (AP) that can be worn at home from dinner to waking up in the morning might be safe and efficient for first routine use in patients with type 1 diabetes. We assessed the effect on glucose control with use of an AP during the evening and night plus patient-managed sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP) during the day, versus 24 h use of patient-managed SAP only, in free-living conditions.
In a crossover study done in medical centres in France, Italy, and the Netherlands, patients aged 18-69 years with type 1 diabetes who used insulin pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion were randomly assigned to 2 months of AP use from dinner to waking up plus SAP use during the day versus 2 months of SAP use only under free-living conditions. Randomisation was achieved with a computer-generated allocation sequence with random block sizes of two, four, or six, masked to the investigator. Patients and investigators were not masked to the type of intervention. The AP consisted of a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pump connected to a modified smartphone with a model predictive control algorithm. The primary endpoint was the percentage of time spent in the target glucose concentration range (3·9-10·0 mmol/L) from 2000 to 0800 h. CGM data for weeks 3-8 of the interventions were analysed on a modified intention-to-treat basis including patients who completed at least 6 weeks of each intervention period. The 2 month study period also allowed us to asses HbA1c as one of the secondary outcomes. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02153190.
During 2000-0800 h, the mean time spent in the target range was higher with AP than with SAP use: 66·7% versus 58·1% (paired difference 8·6% [95% CI 5·8 to 11·4], p<0·0001), through a reduction in both mean time spent in hyperglycaemia (glucose concentration >10·0 mmol/L; 31·6% vs 38·5%; -6·9% [-9·8% to -3·9], p<0·0001) and in hypoglycaemia (glucose concentration <3·9 mmol/L; 1·7% vs 3·0%; -1·6% [-2·3 to -1·0], p<0·0001). Decrease in mean HbA1c during the AP period was significantly greater than during the control period (-0·3% vs -0·2%; paired difference -0·2 [95% CI -0·4 to -0·0], p=0·047), taking a period effect into account (p=0·0034). No serious adverse events occurred during this study, and none of the mild-to-moderate adverse events was related to the study intervention.
Our results support the use of AP at home as a safe and beneficial option for patients with type 1 diabetes. The HbA1c results are encouraging but preliminary.

Using Remote Communication Technology in Insulin Pump Training: A Feasibility Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26420625/),"
This feasibility study was designed to examine if remote communication technology can be used in the technical training of an insulin pump in adults with diabetes who were familiar with insulin pump therapy.
Surveys were emailed to 69 individuals who purchased an insulin pump and had been trained by the manufacturer's diabetes educators. In consultation with providers, participants were given the choice of receiving training in a face-to-face meeting or via remote communication technology. The survey consisted of 27 questions asking participants' characteristics, device proficiency, confidence, and their satisfaction with the insulin pump and the training method. Differences between the 2 groups were examined using bivariate analyses.
There were 17 participants in the remote group and 20 participants in the face-to-face group. Participants had a mean age of 40.9 ± 14.3 years, had diabetes for 24.3 ± 13.8 years, and used an insulin pump for 9.8 ± 4.9 years. The participants in both groups were not statistically different in age, diabetes history, years on insulin pump, device proficiency, confidence, or satisfaction with the training method. The remote group reported less graduate-level education (P < .05) and higher satisfaction scores with the insulin pump training (P < .05).
Although this study has limitations associated with the small sample size and self-selection bias, the results suggest that remote communication technology may be an effective tool to provide technical training to adults who are familiar with insulin pump therapy. Additional research is required to determine the effectiveness of the remote insulin pump training.

Insulin Pumps and Remote Software Updates: A New Way Forward.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26385400/),"
This article discusses the future direction of insulin pump technology and its relationship to the software update process. A user needs analysis revealed that respondents wanted an insulin pump software update process to function much in the same way as smartphone updates. Users of insulin pumps have the same expectations as with other ubiquitous technology such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. The development of a software update system within a regulated environment that meets the needs of insulin pump users by allowing optional software updates that provide access to pump improvements, feature additions, or access to algorithms that provide therapy-changing technologies is a new way forward for the management of a complicated disease that affects more than 450,000 people using insulin pumps in the United States.

Integrated insulin pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring for improved adherence: technology update.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26379428/),"
Insulin pump therapy combined with real-time continuous glucose monitoring, known as sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy, has been shown to improve metabolic control and to reduce the rate of hypoglycemia in adults with type 1 diabetes compared to multiple daily injections or standard continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Glycemic variability is also reduced in patients on SAP therapy. This approach allows patients to monitor their glucose levels being informed of glycemic concentration and trend. Trained diabetic patients, therefore, can appropriately modify insulin infusion and/or carbohydrate intake in order to prevent hypo- or hyperglycemia. For these reasons, SAP therapy is now considered the gold standard for type 1 diabetes treatment. To be clinically effective, however, devices and techniques using advanced technology should not only have the potential to theoretically ameliorate metabolic control, but also be well accepted by patients in terms of satisfaction and health-related quality of life, because these factors will improve treatment adherence and consequently overall outcome. SAP therapy is generally well tolerated by patients; however, many clinical trials have identified significant noncompliance in the use of this device, most notably in the pediatric and adolescent populations. In this review we aim to analyze the main reasons for good or poor adherence to SAP therapy and to provide useful tips in order to fully benefit from this kind of novel therapeutic approach.

Using Insulin Infusion Sets in CSII for Longer Than the Recommended Usage Time Leads to a High Risk for Adverse Events: Results From a Prospective Randomized Crossover Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26341262/),"
Infusion sets for use with insulin pumps are recommended for use for 2 to 3 days to avoid local skin reactions, for example, to the insulin formulation and preservatives like meta-cresol. However, many patients use the catheters longer for economic reasons. We performed this study to investigate the tolerability of 2-day use of infusion sets in comparison to 4-day use in a real-world setting.
This prospective randomized controlled crossover study with 2 × 3-month observation periods was performed with 24 type 1 patients. At baseline, patients were trained on the use of the infusion system (Medtronic /Mio® or inset™ II) and randomized to any of the 2 treatment sequences. Observation parameters included glycemic control, frequency and nature of device-related, and procedure-related adverse events and patient preference.
The per-protocol analysis was performed with 22 patients (5 men, 17 women, age 39 ± 11 years, BMI 27.0 ± 3.5 kg/m2). The number of catheter related adverse events was 290 with 2-day use versus 495 with 4-day use (P < .05). The overall number of treatment related events was 750 with 2-day use versus 934 with 4-day use (P < .001). There was no difference in glycemic control between the treatment arms. Treatment satisfaction was higher with 2-day use (very high/high satisfaction: 90.4% versus 4 day-use: 77.3%, P < .05).
Our results demonstrate that using the infusion sets for a longer usage period of 2-3 days resulted in a clinically relevant increase in treatment-related tolerability problems. Patients should be trained and encouraged not to use insulin pump infusion sets for a longer than the recommended time period.

"Effect of 4 years subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment on albuminuria, kidney function and HbA1c compared with multiple daily injections: a longitudinal follow-up study.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26331364/),"
The effect of insulin pump [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] treatment on diabetes complications in a modern clinical setting is largely unknown. We investigated the effect of 4 years CSII treatment on HbA(1c), albuminuria and kidney function compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) in a single-centre clinical setting.
All patients initiating CSII treatment from 2004 to 2010 and followed for at least 4 years were included in the study: 193 people with Type 1 diabetes were matched (1 : 2) with 386 patients treated with MDI in the same period. Matching was based on diabetes duration, gender, HbA(1c) and normo-, micro- or macroalbuminuria at baseline. Urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) was measured yearly and annual change assessed from linear regression.
CSII- vs. MDI-treated patients were comparable at baseline. After 4 years, HbA(1c) was 62 ± 11 vs. 68 ± 11 mmol/mol (7.8 ± 1.0 vs. 8.4 ± 1.0%) (P < 0.001). Annual UACR change in CSII- vs. MDI-treated patients was [mean (95% confidence interval)] -10.1 (-13.3; -6.8) vs. -1.2 (-3.6; 0.9)% (P < 0.001). Reduction in UACR was significantly associated with CSII treatment after adjustment for age, gender, diabetes duration, estimated GFR, UACR, mean arterial pressure, HbA(1c), cholesterol, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition, anti-hypertensive treatment and smoking (P < 0.001). This remained significant (P < 0.001) when only including patients on stable renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition during follow-up (n = 465).
Treatment with CSII over 4 years independently reduced HbA(1c) and UACR compared with MDI. Reduced UACR may be due to less glycaemic variability because the effect of CSII on HbA(1c) could only partially explain the effect. This needs confirmation in randomized controlled trials.

Evaluation of Intradermal and Subcutaneous Infusion Set Performance Under 24-Hour Basal and Bolus Conditions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26319228/),"
This study sought to assess the function and delivery reliability of intradermal (ID) infusion sets used with commercial insulin pumps.
Healthy subjects (n = 43) were randomized to either ID or subcutaneous (SC) arms, and received basal/bolus placebo delivery for 24 hours. Subjects received 4 of 8 infusion set combinations (ID: microneedle design A or B, with 2 pump brands [Animas or MiniMed]; SC: Teflon Quickset or steel Rapid-D, Animas pump only, with or without overtaping) and were evaluated for pump occlusion alarms, fluid leakage, pain, and tissue tolerability. A novel algorithm was developed to determine flow consistency based on fluid pressure, and the duration and occurrence rate for periods of unalarmed but interrupted flow (""silent occlusions'"") were compared.
ID delivery was successfully maintained over the 24-hour infusion period. The number of silent occlusions was lower for ID microneedle cannula design B than A (P < .01) and lower for Rapid-D SC device compared to Quick-set (P = .03). There was no significant difference in the number of occlusion alarms between the ID and SC devices with the Animas pump. However, the pumps tested with ID devices had significantly different alarm rates (MiniMed 29.5%, Animas 0%, P < .001). Leakage and tissue tolerability were comparable across devices.
The ID infusion set reliably delivered diluent for an extended 24-hour period in healthy subjects and was well tolerated. Silent occlusion flow interruptions could be detected in both ID and SC infusion sets using a proprietary algorithm. This algorithm is a promising method for quantitatively evaluating infusion set flow performance.

Project Baiterek: A Patient Access Program to Improve Clinical Outcomes and Quality of Life in Children with Type 1 Diabetes in Kazakhstan.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29698155/),"
Diabetes is a key driver in the rise of noncommunicable diseases globally. It causes expensive and burdensome short- and long-term complications, with both an economic and social impact. In many countries, however, access to care and disease management in type 1 diabetes is suboptimal, increasing the risk for complications. In 2011, Project Baiterek was initiated as a collaborative effort between the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health, industry (Medtronic Plc), local physicians, and the Diabetes Association of the Republic of Kazakhstan to enhance patient access to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. It was the first countrywide project to provide equity and universal access to insulin pump therapy among children with type 1 diabetes, increasing pump use from zero to two-thirds of this population in less than 3 years. The project also involved instigating longitudinal data collection, and long-term clinical outcomes continue to be monitored. Here, we provide an overview of the clinical, quality-of-life, and economic outcomes to date associated with providing CSII therapy to children with type 1 diabetes in Kazakhstan. Initial clinical data show that CSII therapy improved clinical outcomes and quality of life for patients entered into the program and that CSII therapy was cost-effective relative to multiple daily injection therapy. The positive outcomes of Project Baiterek provide a template for similar patient access programs in other settings, and its framework could be adapted to initiatives to change health care infrastructures and standards of care for other noncommunicable diseases.

Validation of a contemporary adherence measure for children with Type 1 diabetes: the Diabetes Management Questionnaire.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26280463/),"
To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Diabetes Management Questionnaire, a brief, self-report measure of adherence to contemporary diabetes management for young people with Type 1 diabetes and their caregivers.
A total of 273 parent-child dyads completed parallel versions of the Diabetes Management Questionnaire. Eligible children (aged 8-18 years) had Type 1 diabetes for ≥1 year. A multidisciplinary team designed the Diabetes Management Questionnaire as a brief, self-administered measure of adherence to Type 1 diabetes management over the preceding month; higher scores reflect greater adherence. Psychometrics were evaluated for the entire sample and according to age of the child.
The children (49% female) had a mean ± sd (range) age 13.3 ± 2.9 (8-18) years and their mean ± sd HbA1c was 71 ± 15 mmol/mol (8.6 ± 1.4%). Internal consistency was good for parents (α = 0.83) and children (α = 0.79). Test-retest reliability was excellent for parents (intraclass correlation coefficient =0.83) and good for children (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.65). Parent and child scores had moderate agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.54). Diabetes Management Questionnaire scores were inversely associated with HbA1c (parents: r = -0.41, P < 0.0001; children: r = -0.27, P < 0.0001). Psychometrics were stronger in the children aged ≥13 years compared with those aged < 13 years, but were acceptable in both age groups. Mean ± sd Diabetes Management Questionnaire scores were higher among children who were receiving insulin pump therapy (n = 181) than in children receiving multiple daily injections (n = 92) according to parent (75.9 ± 11.8 vs. 70.5 ± 15.5; P = 0.004) and child report (72.2 ± 12.1 vs. 67.6 ± 13.9; P = 0.006).
The Diabetes Management Questionnaire is a brief, valid self-report measure of adherence to contemporary diabetes self-management for people aged 8-18 years who are receiving either multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy.

SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A PERI-OPERATIVE PROTOCOL FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES TREATED WITH CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION WHO ARE ADMITTED FOR SAME-DAY SURGERY.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26280203/),"
The number of people with diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) with an insulin pump has risen dramatically, creating new challenges when these patients are admitted to the hospital for surgical or other procedures. There is limited literature guiding CSII use during surgical procedures.
The study was carried out in a large, urban, tertiary care hospital. We enrolled 49 patients using insulin pump therapy presenting for 57 elective surgeries. We developed a CSII peri-operative glycemic management protocol (PGMP) to standardize insulin pump management in patients admitted to a same-day surgery unit (SDSU). The purpose was evaluate the safety (% capillary blood glucose (CBG) <70 mg/dL and/or pump incidents) and efficacy (first postoperative CBG ≤200 mg/dL) of the CSII PGMP. We determine the contribution of admission CBG, type of anesthesia, surgery length, and peri-operative steroid use on postoperative glycemic control.
Overall, 63% of patients treated according to the CSII PGMP had a first postoperative CBG ≤200 mg/dL. There were no episodes of intra- or postoperative hypoglycemia. For patients treated with the CSII PGMP, the mean postoperative CBG was lower in patients with anticipated or actual surgical length ≤120 minutes (158.1 ± 53.9 vs. 216 ± 77.7 mg/dL, P<.01). No differences were observed with admission CBG, type of anesthesia, or steroid use.
This study demonstrates that a CSII PGMP is both safe and effective for patients admitted for elective surgical procedures and provides an example of a standardized protocol for use in clinical practice.

Insulin-based strategies to prevent hypoglycaemia during and after exercise in adult patients with type 1 diabetes on pump therapy: the DIABRASPORT randomized study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26264812/),"
To validate strategies to prevent exercise-induced hypoglycaemia via insulin-dose adjustment in adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) on pump therapy.
A total of 20 patients randomly performed four 30-min late post-lunch (3 h after lunch) exercise sessions and a rest session: two moderate sessions [50% maximum oxygen consumption (VO2 max)] with 50 or 80% basal rate (BR) reduction during exercise + 2 h and two intense sessions (75% VO2 max) with 80% BR reduction or with their pump stopped. Two additional early post-lunch sessions (90 min after lunch) were analysed to compare hypoglycaemia incidence for BR reduction versus bolus reduction.
In all, 100 late post-lunch sessions were analysed. Regardless of exercise type and BR reduction, no more hypoglycaemic events occurred in the period until the next morning than occurred after the rest sessions. In the afternoon, no more hypoglycaemic events occurred with 80% BR reduction/moderate exercise or with pump discontinuation/intense exercise than for the rest session, whereas more hypoglycaemic events occurred with 50% BR reduction/moderate exercise and 80% BR reduction/intense exercise. After early post-lunch exercise (n = 37), a trend towards fewer hypoglycaemic episodes was observed with bolus reduction versus BR reduction (p = 0.07). Mean blood glucose fell by ∼3.3 mmol/l after 30 min of exercise, irrespective of dose reduction, remaining stable until the next morning with no rebound hyperglycaemia.
In adults with T1D, to limit the hypoglycaemic risk associated with 30 min of exercise 3 h after lunch, without carbohydrate supplements, the best options seem to be to reduce BR by 80% or to stop the pump for moderate or intense exercise, or for moderate exercise 90 min after lunch, to reduce the prandial bolus rather than the BR.

Who gains clinical benefit from using insulin pump therapy? A qualitative study of the perceptions and views of health professionals involved in the Relative Effectiveness of Pumps over MDI and Structured Education (REPOSE) trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26248590/),"
To explore health professionals' views about insulin pump therapy [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] and the types of individuals they thought would gain greatest clinical benefit from using this treatment.
In-depth interviews with staff (n = 18) who delivered the Relative Effectiveness of Pumps Over MDI and Structured Education (REPOSE) trial. Data were analysed thematically.
Staff perceived insulin pumps as offering a better self-management tool to some individuals due to the drip feed of insulin, the ability to alter basal rates and other advanced features. However, staff also noted that, because of the diversity of features on offer, CSII is a more technically complex therapy to execute than multiple daily injections. For this reason, staff described how, alongside clinical criteria, they had tended to select individuals for CSII in routine clinical practice based on their perceptions about whether they possessed the personal and psychological attributes needed to make optimal use of pump technology. Staff also described how their assumptions about personal and psychological suitability had been challenged by working on the REPOSE trial and observing individuals make effective use of CSII who they would not have recommended for this type of therapy in routine clinical practice.
Our findings add to those studies that highlight the difficulties of using patient characteristics and variables to predict clinical success using CSII. To promote equitable access to CSII, attitudinal barriers and prejudicial assumptions amongst staff about who is able to make effective use of CSII may need to be addressed.

Many patients with type 2 diabetes struggle to achieve adequate glucose control despite escalation of therapy including complex insulin regimens with multiple daily injections (MDIs). Previous randomised controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in glycaemic control with pump therapy over multiple injections. The OPT2MISE study enrolled 495 adult patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes despite an intensified insulin regimen using rapid and slow-acting insulin analogues. After a 2-month run-in period, patients were randomised to switch to pump therapy or to maintain their MDI regimen. After 6 months, patients with pump therapy achieved a better glycaemic control than those who used multiple injections (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] difference of -0.7 %), and twice as many patients reached the target range of 8 % or less in the pump-therapy group compared with the injection group. Patients using pump therapy had a 20 % reduction of their total daily insulin dose. A moderate weight gain was observed with both treatments, and no severe hypoglycaemia nor ketoacidosis occurred in the pump therapy group. Pump therapy may now be considered as a valuable option in type 2 diabetes patients who fail to respond to an intensified insulin regimen.

Are late-night eating habits and sleep duration associated with glycemic control in adult type 1 diabetes patients treated with insulin pumps?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26221525/),"
Little is known about the impact of sleep duration and late-night snacking on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes using insulin pumps. The aim of the present study was to examine whether late-night eating habits and short sleep duration are associated with glycemic control in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion-treated type 1 diabetic patients.
We included 148 consecutive adult type 1 diabetic subjects using an insulin pump (100 women and 48 men). Participants completed a questionnaire regarding sleep duration (classified as short if ≤6 h) and late-night snacking. Other sources of information included medical records and data from blood glucose meters. Glycemic control was assessed by glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and mean self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) readings.
The mean age of patients was 26 years, mean type 1 diabetes duration was 13.4 years and mean HbA1c level was 7.2%. In a univariate regression analysis, sleep duration was a predictor of both HbA1c (β = 0.51, P = 0.01) and SMBG levels (β = 11.4, P = 0.02). Additionally, an association was found between frequent late-night snacking and higher SMBG readings (often snacking β = 18.1, P = 0.05), but not with increased HbA1c levels. In the multivariate linear regression, independent predictors for HbA1c and SMBG were sleep duration and patient age. In a univariate logistic regression, sleep duration and frequency of late-night snacking were not predictors of whether HbA1c target levels were achieved.
Short sleep duration, but not late-night snacking, seems to be associated with poorer glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

To systematically review the effectiveness of systemic interventions for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in type 1 diabetes.
Systematic review and meta-analysis.
MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library were searched for studies published from January 1990 to December 2014. Randomized controlled trials and controlled cohort studies reporting incidence or progression of DR following systemic intervention were included. Two reviewers selected studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. For each intervention, pooled outcomes were reported as relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Twenty-four studies involving 9302 patients met inclusion criteria. Incident DR was reduced by intensive vs conventional insulin therapy (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.23-0.83), insulin pumps vs multiple daily injections (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.24-0.83), and angiotensin receptor blockade vs placebo (RR 0.65; 95% CI 0.49-0.85). The benefit of insulin pumps over multiple daily infections was independent of HbA1c. DR progression was reduced by intensive vs conventional insulin therapy (RR 0.63; 95% CI 0.43-0.92), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition vs placebo (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41-0.86), and islet cell transplantation vs medical therapy (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.08-0.71).
Intensive insulin therapy, and specifically insulin pump therapy vs multiple daily injections, prevents DR in both adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Antihypertensive agents provide protection in normotensive, normoalbuminuric adults. In patients with type 1 diabetes of longer duration, islet cell transplantation may be more effective than medical therapy. There is insufficient evidence for antilipid therapy or other systemic interventions.

Needle detachment in a slim and physically active child with insulin pump treatment.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26201949/),"
Insulin pump therapy (CSII) is well established in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. In childhood diabetes, insulin pump treatment shows considerable advantages such as fewer injections, increased flexibility, fewer hypoglycemic events and lower HbA1c levels. Side effects such as catheter obstruction, technical pump failure, and dermatological complications have been observed, but are rarely reported. The reported patient is a physically very active and slim 10-year-old boy with reduced subcutaneous fatty tissue. After strong muscular activity an accidental rupture of the infusion set and needle detachment occurred in October 2013. X-ray and ultrasound imaging localized the needle in the musculus rectus femoris dexter. The needle was kept in situ and oral antibiotic treatment to prevent inflammatory reaction was prescribed. Repeated ultrasound measurements documented that the needles position had remained unchanged. Steel needle catheters (Sure-T infusion set, 6 mm) positioned in a thin layer of subcutaneous fat tissue of the thigh, combined with intense sports activity can result in a needle rupture and penetration into the muscle. Careful monitoring provides an alternative to surgery and lowers the risk of muscular necrosis. Because of differences in the distribution of subcutaneous fat tissue, an individualized catheter selection is necessary in pump treatment for children and adolescents, requiring a variety of different catheter sets.

Continuous glucose monitoring and hypoglycemia unawareness in type 1 diabetes: a pilot study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26159765/),"
Looking for strict normoglycemia in type 1 diabetes increases the risk of hypoglycemia, exposing to hypoglycemia unawareness. It has been shown that the early correction of hypoglycemia can help recovering the perception of hypoglycemia. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the value of sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy to treat hypoglycemia unawareness.
Eleven patients with type 1 diabetes and partial or total hypoglycemia unawareness received sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy combined to the low blood glucose-suspend feature (Paradigm® Veo™ pump and Enlite® sensors) for three months.
Eighty per cent of the patients improved their hypoglycemia unawareness with an increase in the hypoglycemia perception threshold of 31 mg/dL as evaluated by blinded continuous glucose monitoring. These results were correlated to a self-assessment quiz evaluation. Results were sustained at six months (three months after patients stopped using the system). Sensitive neuropathy, untreated hypoglycemia and the area under the curve for hypoglycemia events were associated with less chance of recovery. These devices were globally considered by the patients as simple to use, with no major disadvantages and only a single withdrawal occurred.
Sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy should be considered as a possible treatment of hypoglycemia unawareness.

Position Statement on the management of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII): The Italian Lazio experience.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26118939/),"
This document has been developed by a group of Italian diabetologists with extensive experience in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy to provide indications for the clinical management of CSII in diabetic patients (both type 1 and type 2) based on delivery mode operating in Italy. Although the potential benefits of pump therapy in achieving glycemic goals is now accepted, such results cannot be obtained without specific knowledge and skills being conveyed to patients during ad hoc educational training. To ensure that these new technologies reach their full effectiveness, as demonstrated theoretically and clinically, a careful assessment of the overall therapeutic and educational process is required, in both qualitative and quantitative terms. Therefore, to ensure the cost-effectiveness of insulin pump therapy and to justify reimbursement of therapy costs by the National Health System in Italy, in this article we present a model for diabetes and healthcare centers to follow that provides for different levels of expertise in the field of CSII therapy. This model will guarantee the provision of excellent care during insulin pump therapies, thus representing the basis for a successful outcome and expansion of this form of insulin treatment in patients with diabetes while also keeping costs under control.

With multiple daily injections as reference, the adjusted hazard ratios for insulin pump treatment were significantly lower: 0.55 (95% confidence interval 0.36 to 0.83) for fatal coronary heart disease, 0.58 (0.40 to 0.85) for fatal cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease or stroke), and 0.73 (0.58 to 0.92) for all cause mortality. Hazard ratios were lower, but not significantly so, for fatal or non-fatal coronary heart disease and fatal or non-fatal cardiovascular disease. Unadjusted absolute differences were 3.0 events of fatal coronary heart disease per 1000 person years; corresponding figures were 3.3 for fatal cardiovascular disease and 5.7 for all cause mortality. When lower body mass index and previous cardiovascular diseases were excluded, results of subgroup analyses were similar to the results from complete data. A sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounders in all individuals showed that an unmeasured confounders with hazard ratio of 1.3 would have to be present in >80% of the individuals treated with multiple daily injections versus not presence in those treated with pump therapy to invalidate the significantly lower hazard ratios for fatal cardiovascular disease. Data on patient education and frequency of blood glucose monitoring were missing, which might have influenced the observed association.
Among people with type 1 diabetes use of insulin pump therapy is associated with lower cardiovascular mortality than treatment with multiple daily insulin injections.

Update on a Quality Initiative to Standardize Perioperative Care for Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092687/),"
The objective of the analysis was to review the effectiveness of a care process model (CPM) developed to guide management of patients on insulin pump therapy undergoing elective surgical procedures.
Electronic medical records were reviewed to assess the impact of the CPM on documentation of insulin pump status, glucose monitoring, and safety during the perioperative phase of care. Post-CPM care was compared with management provided before CPM implementation.
We reviewed 45 cases on insulin pump therapy in the pre-CPM cohort and 106 in the post-CPM cohort. Demographic characteristics, categories of surgery, and perioperative times were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Recommended hemoglobin A1c monitoring occurred in 73% of cases in the pre-CPM cohort but improved to 94% in the post-CPM group (P < .01). There was a higher frequency of documentation of the insulin pump during the preoperative, intraoperative, and postanesthesia care unit segments of care in the post- vs pre-CPM periods (all P < .01). The number of cases with intraoperative glucose monitoring increased (57% pre-CPM vs 81% post-CPM; P < .01). Glycemic control was comparable between the 2 CPM periods. Hypoglycemia was rare, with only 3 episodes in the pre-CPM group and 4 in the post-CPM. No adverse events associated with perioperative insulin pump use were observed.
This analysis adds to previous data on use of insulin pump therapy during the perioperative period. Some processes require additional attention, but data continue to indicate that a standardized approach to care can lead to a successful and safe transition of insulin pump therapy throughout the perioperative period.

Clinical review: insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26092321/),"
Insulin pumps are a vital and rapidly developing tool in the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus in both adults and children. Many studies have highlighted outcomes and assessed their potential advantages, but much of the data on adverse outcomes are limited and often based on outdated technology. We aimed to review and summarize the available literature on insulin pump-associated adverse events in adults and children.
A literature search was undertaken using PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library. Articles were then screened by title, followed by abstract, and full text as needed. A by-hand search of reference lists in identified papers was also utilised. All searches were limited to English language material, but no time limits were used.
Current and past literature regarding insulin pump-associated adverse events is discussed, including potential metabolic and non-metabolic adverse events, in particular: pump malfunction; infusion set/site issues; and cutaneous problems. We show that even with modern technology, adverse events are common, occurring in over 40Â % of users per year, with a minority, particularly in children, requiring hospital management. Hyperglycaemia and ketosis are now the most common consequences of adverse events and are usually associated with infusion set failure. This differs from older technology where infected infusion sites predominated.
This timely review covers all potential insulin pump-associated adverse events, including their incidence, features, impacts, and contributory factors such as the pump user. The importance of ongoing anticipatory education and support for patients and families using this intensive insulin technology is highlighted, which if done well should improve the overall experience of pump therapy for users, and hopefully reduce the incidence and impact of severe adverse events.

Insulin Pump and CGM Usage in the United States and Germany: Results of a Real-World Survey With 985 Subjects.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26071425/),"
This survey collected and evaluated user responses about routine tasks and preferences regarding insulin pumps and infusion sets (IIS) with comparison of intercountry differences between the United States (US) and Germany (GER), chosen for their large insulin pump populations.
A total of 985 subjects (534 US, 451 GER; 60% female) with type 1 diabetes on pump therapy anonymously answered 20 pump-related questions. US subjects also answered 11 questions about continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) usage.
Length of use of insulin cartridges is shorter in US than in GER, mean (SD) 4.3 (5.0) versus 5.3 (3.2) days (P < .001), while the IIS is used longer: 3.3 (1.0) versus 2.7 (1.1) days (P < .001). Lower self-reported HbA1c levels were associated with longer use of insulin cartridges (7.3% for >3 days vs. 7.7% for <3 days; P < .01), and with use of an auto-insertion device (vs. manual IIS insertion) in the US (7.2% vs. 6.9%), but not in GER (7.7% vs. 7.9%). Only 47% of pump wearers stated that they were ""very satisfied"" with their pump (49% US vs. 45% GER, ns). However, 98% would recommend the pump to others (95% vs. 93%, ns). Analysis of CGM questions showed that 297 (60%) of 496 US responders currently wore one. Of these, 84% said they would recommend CGM to others. CGM wearers who stated they were ""very satisfied"" with their CGM had lower HbA1c than those who said they were ""partly satisfied"" (6.9% vs. 7.2%).
This survey shows interesting differences in real-world use of insulin pumps in 2 large markets, and suggests areas where insulin pumps and CGMs might be improved.

Additional benefits of the dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) artificial pancreas compared with the single-hormone (insulin alone) artificial pancreas have not been assessed in young people in outpatient unrestricted conditions. We evaluated the efficacy of three systems for nocturnal glucose control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
We did a randomised, three-way, crossover trial in children aged 9-17 years with type 1 diabetes attending a diabetes camp in Canada. With use of sealed envelopes, children were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio with blocks of six to different sequences of the three interventions (single-hormone artificial pancreas, dual-hormone artificial pancreas, and conventional continuous subcutaneous insulin pump therapy). Each intervention was applied for 3 consecutive nights. Participants, study staff, and endpoint assessors were not masked. The primary outcome was the percentage of time spent with glucose concentrations lower than 4·0 mmol/L from 2300 h to 0700 h. Analysis was by intention to treat. A p value of less than 0·0167 was regarded as significant. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02189694.
Between June 30, 2014, and Aug 9, 2014, we enrolled 33 children of mean age 13·3 years (SD 2·3; range 9-17). The time spent at a glucose concentration lower than 4·0 mmol/L was median 0% (IQR 0·0-2·4) during nights with the dual-hormone artificial pancreas, 3·1% (0·0-6·9) during nights with the single-hormone artificial pancreas (p=0·032), and 3·4% (0-11·0) during nights with conventional pump therapy (p=0·0048 compared with dual-hormone artificial pancreas and p=0·32 compared with single-hormone artificial pancreas). 15 hypoglycaemic events (<3·1 mmol/L for 20 min measured by sensor then confirmed with capillary glucose <4·0 mmol/L) were noted during nights with conventional pump therapy compared with four events with the single-hormone system and no events with the dual-hormone system. None of the assessed outcomes varied with the order in which children and young adults were assigned interventions.
The dual-hormone artificial pancreas could improve nocturnal glucose control in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Longer and larger outpatient studies are now needed.

Analysis of insulin pump settings in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25998469/),"
To characterize current insulin pump settings used in young patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and to assess their relationship to glycemic control.
This retrospective study included patients aged <18 yr old with T1DM >1 yr using a Medtronic pump device. Pump data including number of blood glucose (BG) tests per day, basal and bolus insulin parameters, carbohydrate ratio (CR), and insulin sensitivity factors (ISFs) were averaged over 14 d for statistical analyses. Anthropometric data and recent glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were recorded.
A total of 292 patients (144 males and 148 females) were included in the study. Participants had a median age (interquartile range, IQR) of 12.9 yr (10.0-15.1 yr) and pump duration of 2.8 yr (1.5-4.2 yr). No significant differences in median HbA1c (IQR) were observed in preschool [n = 14; HbA1c 7.8% (7.3-8.3%)], prepubertal [n = 105; HbA1c 8.1% (7.7-8.9%)], and adolescent subjects [n = 173; HbA1c 8.4% (7.7-9.0%)]. Adolescents took significantly fewer boluses and BG tests per day compared with younger children (p < 0.05). Age-specific diurnal variation in basal insulin delivery was noted. Additionally, stronger carbohydrate cover and weaker corrections were used in real-life compared with theoretical 500 and 100 rules, respectively. Lower HbA1c was associated with higher number of daily boluses, greater number of BG tests per day, lower average CR/500 rule ratio, and higher average ISF/100 rule ratio adjusted for age (R(2) = 0.22; p < 0.01).
Insulin pump therapy requires continuous adjustments and glycemic targets are achieved by a minority. We believe this is the first study in pediatric cohort looking at association between CR and ISF with glycemic control.

Optimization of insulin pump therapy based on high order run-to-run control scheme.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25981797/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump is widely considered a convenience and promising way for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) subjects, who need exogenous insulin infusion. In the standard insulin pump therapy, there are two modes for insulin infusion: basal and bolus insulin. The basal-bolus therapy should be individualized and optimized in order to keep one subject's blood glucose (BG) level within the normal range; however, the optimization procedure is troublesome and it perturb the patients a lot. Therefore, an automatic adjustment method is needed to reduce the burden of the patients, and run-to-run (R2R) control algorithm can be used to handle this significant task.
In this study, two kinds of high order R2R control methods are presented to adjust the basal and bolus insulin simultaneously. For clarity, a second order R2R control algorithm is first derived and studied. Furthermore, considering the differences between weekdays and weekends, a seventh order R2R control algorithm is also proposed and tested.
In order to simulate real situation, the proposed method has been tested with uncertainties on measurement noise, drifts, meal size, meal time and snack. The proposed method can converge even when there are ±60 min random variations in meal timing or ±50% random variations in meal size.
According to the robustness analysis, one can see that the proposed high order R2R has excellent robustness and could be a promising candidate to optimize insulin pump therapy.

Efficacy of Insulin Pump Therapy on Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction and Glycemic Control Among Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus in Saudi Arabia: A Prospective Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25924588/),"
The aim of this study was to explore the impact of insulin pump therapy on diabetes treatment satisfaction and glycemic control among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in Saudi Arabia.
A 6-month, prospective study was conducted among 47 patients (aged 17-24 years) with T1DM who attended the Insulin Pump Clinic at Prince Sultan Military Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between April 2014 and November 2014. The respondents were purposively and conveniently selected and were interviewed using the Arabic version of the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Demographics and clinical variables including hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were also collected.
The mean (±standard deviation) age of the study cohort was 19.1 ± 1.93 years. Seventeen patients were male (36.2%) and 30 were female (63.8%). Compared to baseline, significant positive differences were found in treatment satisfaction among female patients and patients with long-standing T1DM at 6 months. Frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia declined significantly in female patients at 6 months and in patients who had a shorter duration of T1DM. Furthermore, significant positive differences were found in HbA1c levels among female patients and among those who had a shorter duration of T1DM compared to baseline. Both female and male patients and those with a shorter duration of T1DM showed a significant decline in insulin necessity at 6 months when compared to baseline.
Although multiple daily injections is a feasible preference for insulin supply, insulin pumps should also be considered for patients with T1DM as it appears to increase patients' treatment satisfaction, decrease the frequency of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and reduce HbA1c levels.

To conduct an audit of insulin pump therapy in the UK after the issue of guidelines for the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by NICE in 2008 (Technology Appraisal 151).
All centres in the UK, providing pump services to children and young people were invited to participate in an online audit. Audit metrics were aligned to NICE Technology Appraisal 151 and an electronic data collection tool was used.
Of the 176 UK centres identified as providing pump services, 166 (94.3%) participated in the study. A total of 5094 children and young people were identified as using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (19% of all paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes), with a median (range) of 16.9 (0.67-69.4)% per centre. Units had a median of 0.58 consultant sessions, 0.43 full-time equivalent diabetic specialist nurses, and 0.1 full-time equivalent dieticians delivering the pump service. The majority of this time was not formally funded. Families could access 24-h clinical and technical support (83% units), although the delivery varied between consultant, diabetic specialist nurse and company representatives. Only 53% of units ran, or accessed, structured education programmes for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion use. Most units (86%) allowed continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion use for paediatric inpatients, but only 56% had written guidelines for this scenario. Nine percent of units had encountered funding refusal for a patient fulfilling NICE (Technology Appraisal 151) criteria.
The number of children and young people on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy is consistent with numbers estimated by NICE. There is a worrying lack of funded healthcare professional time. The audit also identified gaps in the provision of structured education and absence of written inpatient guidelines.

"Insulin pump risks and benefits: a clinical appraisal of pump safety standards, adverse event reporting and research needs. A joint statement of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Technology Working Group.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25784563/),"
Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), is an important and evolving form of insulin delivery, which is mainly used for people with type 1 diabetes. However, even with modern insulin pumps, errors of insulin infusion can occur due to pump failure, insulin infusion set (IIS) blockage, infusion site problems, insulin stability issues, user error or a combination of these. Users are therefore exposed to significant and potentially fatal hazards: interruption of insulin infusion can result in hyperglycaemia and ketoacidosis; conversely, delivery of excessive insulin can cause severe hypoglycaemia. Nevertheless, the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of CSII remains limited. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and American Diabetes Association (ADA) have therefore joined forces to review the systems in place for evaluating the safety of pumps from a clinical perspective. We found that useful information held by the manufacturing companies is not currently shared in a sufficiently transparent manner. Public availability of adverse event (AE) reports on the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is potentially a rich source of safety information but is insufficiently utilised due to the current configuration of the system; the comparable database in Europe (European Databank on Medical Devices, EUDAMED) is not publicly accessible. Many AEs appear to be attributable to human factors and/or user error, but the extent to which manufacturing companies are required by regulators to consider the interactions of users with the technical features of their products is limited. The clinical studies required by regulators prior to marketing are small and over-reliant on bench testing in relation to 'predicate' products. Once a pump is available on the market, insufficient data are made publicly available on its long-term use in a real-world setting; such data could provide vital information to help healthcare teams to educate and support users, and thereby prevent AEs. As well as requiring more from the manufacturing companies, we call for public funding of more research addressing clinically important questions in relation to pump therapy: both observational studies and clinical trials. At present there are significant differences in the regulatory systems between the USA and European Union at both pre- and post-marketing stages; improvements in the European system are more urgently required. This statement concludes with a series of recommended specific actions for 'meknovigilance' (i.e. a standardised safety approach to technology) which could be implemented to address the shortcomings we highlight.

Modern clinical management helps reducing the impact of type 1 diabetes in children.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25779986/),"
Type 1 diabetes care may be very costly not only in terms of money but also in terms of psychological and therapeutic acceptance and compliance. Recently, a lot of new technologies have been introduced in the care of patients with type 1 diabetes that should allow them to achieve an improvement in glycemic control, quality of life and above all prevent long-term complications. Combining continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) provides a more useful tool for patients with type 1 diabetes, the sensor-augmented pump (SAP). The aim of the present review is to explore SAP efficacy and safety in young patients with type 1 diabetes. SAP demonstrated increased efficacy in lowering glycated hemoglobin when compared either to multiple daily injections or CSII alone. Its efficacy is positively associated with CGM use, baseline HbA1c and patients' age. According to currently available evidence, SAP seems sufficiently safe, effective and beneficial in improving glycemic control in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, encouraging results using semi-closed loop systems are emerging, paving the way toward a fully automated artificial pancreas. As pediatric diabetologists we have the duty to offer our patients the best therapeutic option currently available, supported by evidence, to help them gain the best results with the fewest adverse effects (hypoglycemia and/or diabetic ketoacidosis), better if chomping a little piece of dark chocolate.

Electromagnetic interference from electronic devices used in the management of type 1 diabetes can impair the performance of an avalanche transceiver in search mode.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25772820/),"
Portable electronic devices play an important role in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Electromagnetic interference from electronic devices has been shown to impair the function of an avalanche transceiver in search mode (but not in transmitting mode). This study investigates the influence of electromagnetic interference from diabetes devices on a searching avalanche beacon.
The greatest distance at which an avalanche transceiver (in search mode) could accurately indicate the location of a transmitting transceiver was assessed when portable electronic devices (including an insulin pump and commonly used real-time continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring system [rtCGMS]) were held in close proximity to each transceiver.
The searching transceiver could accurately locate a transmitted signal at a distance of 30 m when used alone. This distance was unchanged by the Dexcom G4 rtCGMS, but was reduced to 10 m when the Medtronic Guardian rtCGMS was held close (within 30 cm) to the receiving beacon. Interference from the Animas Vibe insulin pump reduced this distance to 5 m, impairing the searching transceiver in a manner identical to the effect of a cell phone.
Electromagnetic interference produced by some diabetes devices when held within 30 cm of a searching avalanche transceiver can impair the ability to locate a signal. Such interference could significantly compromise the outcome of a companion rescue scenario. Further investigation using other pumps and rtCGMS devices is required to evaluate all available diabetes electronics. Meantime, all electronic diabetes devices including rtCGMS and insulin pumps should not be used within 30 cm of an avalanche transceiver.

To analyze the available information about continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems in the public health care system of the Community of Madrid.
A survey consisting of 31 items was sent to the 28 endocrinology department of the Madrid public hospitals. Items focused on CSII and CGM and included patients' registrations, as well as data regarding healthcare, administrative, and logistic aspects. Responses from a total of 20 hospitals where these procedures are used were received from March 2013 to May 2014. Data about pediatric patients were obtained from adult endocrinology departments, except for two hospitals which directly reported the information.
A total of 1256 CSII pumps were recorded in the Madrid region, of which 1089 were used by adults, and the remaining 167 by pediatric patients. During 2013, 151 new CSII systems were implanted (12% of the total), while 14 pumps were withdrawn. Availability of human resources (medical assistance) and the number of staff practitioners experienced in management of these systems widely varied between hospitals. Eighty-five percent of hospitals used retrospective CGM systems, and 40% routinely placed them before starting an insulin pump. Thirteen hospitals (65%) used long-term, real-time CGM systems in selected cases (a total of 67 patients).
Use of these technologies in diabetes is unequal between public health care hospitals in Madrid, and is still significantly lower as compared to other countries with similar incomes. However, there appears to be a trend to an increase in their use.

Frequency of dermatological side effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25607337/),"
The incidence of type 1 diabetes is rising, particularly in young infants. The treatment with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) offers certain benefits and has gained popularity. Insulin-pump therapy could be associated with cutaneous-adverse effects. The purpose of our study was to investigate the frequency and characterization of skin-related complications in patients with CSII.
In a single center setting, 54 patients (28 male, 26 female) on CSII therapy aged between 3 and 20 years participated in our study. Data including duration of diabetes, duration of CSII, pump model, catheter material, frequency of catheter switch and hygiene procedures at time of puncture were collected through a standardized questionnaire and photographs of affected areas of the skin were made. Statistical analysis was done to verify an association with gender, patients' age, HbA1c values, and body mass index.
Our observation revealed skin complications at the site of catheter insertion in 43% (8 f, 15 m) of our patients. A frequent occurrence of scars (24%, 6 f, 7 m), lipohypertrophic areas (20%, 4 f, 7 m) and eczema (11%, 1 f, 5 m) was observed. Furthermore, 6% (1 f, 2 m) showed changes in pigmentation and 6% (1 f, 2 m) lipoatrophy. The catheter localization had to be switched due to skin-complications in 24% (6 f, 7 m) whereas none of our patients discontinued insulin-pump therapy.
Skin-related complications during CSII are frequent and regular examination of the insertion sites is crucial. To verify the occurrence of lipoatrophy associated with insulin pump therapy - an otherwise rare complication - larger studies would be needed.

Studies of closed-loop control (CLC) systems have improved glucose levels in patients with type 1 diabetes. In this study we test a new CLC concept aiming to ""reset"" the patient overnight to near-normoglycemia each morning, for several consecutive nights.
Ten insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes (mean age, 46.4±8.5 years) were enrolled in a two-center (in the United States and Italy) randomized crossover trial comparing 5 consecutive nights of CLC (23:00-07:00 h) in an outpatient setting versus sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy of the same duration at home. Primary end points included time spent in 80-140 mg/dL as measured by continuous glucose monitoring overnight and fasting blood glucose distribution at 7:00 h.
Compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy, CLC improved significantly time spent between 80 and 140 mg/dL (54.5% vs. 32.2%; P<0.001) and between 70 and 180 mg/dL (85.4% vs. 59.1%; P<0.001); CLC reduced the mean glucose level at 07:00 h (119.3 vs. 152.9 mg/dL; P<0.001) and overnight mean glucose level (139.0 vs. 170.3 mg/dL; P<0.001) using a marginally lower amount of insulin (6.1 vs. 6.8 units; P=0.1). Tighter overnight control led to improved daytime control on the next day: the overnight/next-day control correlation was r=0.52, P<0.01.
Multinight CLC of insulin delivery (artificial pancreas) results in significant improvement in morning and overnight glucose levels and time in target range, with the potential to improve daytime control when glucose levels were ""reset"" to near-normoglycemia each morning.

Performance and acceptability of a combined device for insulin infusion and glucose sensing in the home setting.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25591857/),"
The use of sensor-augmented insulin pump (SAP) therapy is increasing. Currently, glucose sensors and insulin infusion cannulas are inserted separately. A new device, MiniMed Duo, combines sensing and infusion capabilities on the same platform and is intended to simplify device insertion and site management. We evaluated the device's performance with respect to insulin delivery and glucose sensing, and its acceptability with patients. Forty-five patients (mean ± SD age, 45.5 ± 10.9 years, 48% female) with type 1 diabetes and previous use of SAP participated. Each subject was to wear 5 devices connected to insulin pumps over 15 days (3 days/device) and test capillary blood glucose (SMBG) 7 times/day. The primary endpoint was the percentage of sensor-SMBG paired values within 20% of one another. Subject experiences were assessed via questionnaires. Overall, 74.8% of sensor-SMBG paired values were within 20%, meeting the primary accuracy endpoint, and the mean absolute relative difference was 15.5 ± 17.1%. Consensus error grid analysis showed that >95% of points were within the A+B zones, exceeding the threshold for adequate clinical accuracy. Insulin dosage and SMBG values did not change significantly compared to prestudy values. The functional survival of the device entering day 3 was 90.5%. There were no serious adverse events. Mean questionnaire results indicated overall satisfaction with the device. Duo provided insulin infusion and glucose sensing capabilities in a single device, which provided accurate glucose readings during routine use, was safe to wear, and was acceptable to most patients. It may improve satisfaction and convenience for patients using sensor-augmented insulin pumps.

The effects of transition by individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) to more recently available continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-enabled insulin pumps from either multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or older insulin pumps on treatment satisfaction have not been well studied. We conducted a survey to assess treatment satisfaction among users of the Animas(®) Vibe™ insulin pump, a latest generation insulin pump (LGIP) system (CGM-enabled), after switching from MDI or earlier generation insulin pumps. Individuals with T1D from 141 centers in 5 countries and 4 language areas participated in the survey. Treatment satisfaction was assessed by the Insulin Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (ITSQ), which was included in a 50-item online questionnaire that also assessed preference for using the LGIP compared with previous treatment and satisfaction with key LGIP features. A total of 356 individuals, ages 12-79 years, responded to the survey: mean (SD) age 38.4 (16.1) years; diabetes duration 19.1 (13.3) years; female 59%; previously treated with MDI 58%. Overall mean (SD) ITSQ scores were high among all respondents regardless of prior treatment: 95.1 (23.2) (scale: 0-132). No differences between previous-treatment groups were seen. Most (83%) of respondents rated the LGIP to be better than their previous insulin delivery system: ""much better"" (65%), ""a bit better"" (18%) regardless of age, and 95% would recommend using the LGIP to others. Use of the Animas Vibe was associated with high treatment satisfaction and perceived as a better method of insulin delivery regardless of previous insulin therapy or age.

Parents' experiences of managing their child's diabetes using an insulin pump: a qualitative study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581347/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion delivered via a pump is increasingly recommended for younger children with Type 1 diabetes. Our aims were: to understand the impact on parents who care for young children using insulin pumps; to help interpret psychological outcomes reported in quantitative research; and to inform provision of support to future parents.
We conducted in-depth interviews with 19 parents of children (aged ≤ 12 years) with Type 1 diabetes who used an insulin pump. Data were analysed thematically.
Parents reported multiple benefits from using insulin pumps, including: no longer having to administer painful injections; fewer restrictions on the frequency, timing and carbohydrate contents of snacks and meals; and improvements in family life and their child's glycaemic control. Parents liked and felt less anxious about using bolus calculators to determine insulin doses; however, parents also described undertaking additional and unanticipated work to manage their child's diabetes using a pump. This included performing more blood glucose tests to calculate insulin doses for snacks and to address their concerns that the pump increased their child's risk of hypoglycaemia. Some parents reported doing additional blood glucose checks because they could adjust pump settings to better manage hypo- and hyperglycaemia.
Parents liked and perceived benefits for their child and themselves from using an insulin pump; however, parents would benefit from being made aware of the additional work involved in using a pump and also from education and support to address concerns about hypoglycaemia. Better measures to evaluate parents' experiences are also recommended.

Achievement of metabolic control goals set by the American Diabetes Association and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes from Spain.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25595220/),"
The ""T1D Exchange Clinic Registry"" of 13.316 pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in U.S. recently revealed that most children have HbA1c values above target levels established by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD). The aim of this study is to assess the proportion of youngsters with T1D who meet the internationally accepted targets for good metabolic control of diabetes at a single, referral Pediatric Diabetes Center in Spain.
Cross-sectional study of 236 children and adolescents with T1D controlled at our Pediatric Diabetes Unit. We analyzed the compliance to metabolic goals set by ADA and ISPAD and the differences between patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily injections.
SPSS™ version 21.0.
Mean age: 12.6 ± 4.6 years old, mean age at diagnosis: 6.1 ± 4.3 years old and mean diabetes duration: 6.4 ± 4.3 years; 47% female. HbA1c average: 6.7 ± 0.7% (49.7 ± 7.6 mmol/mol). The age-specific ADA and ISPAD HbA1c targets were achieved by 93% and 91% of patients, respectively. Among pump users, 97%/97% met ADA/ISPAD HbA1c targets compared to 87%/88% of MDI users (p = 0.04/p = 0.03), without significant differences in the analysis by groups of age. Among participants, 95%, 62%, 95%, 98% and 89% met HDLc, LDLc, triglycerides, BP and BMI targets.
Most patients in our children and adolescent cohort of T1D patients correctly achieve metabolic goals established by ADA and ISPAD with low incidence of hypoglycemia.

Real-time continuous glucose monitoring in type 1 diabetes: a qualitative framework analysis of patient narratives.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25552422/),"
This study analyzed narratives about experiences of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in people with type 1 diabetes.
People with type 1 diabetes using CGM and caregivers completed an online survey. Questions included duration of CGM, frequency of sensor wear, funding, and a free narrative about experiences or views about CGM. We used qualitative framework analysis to analyze 100 responses; 50% of participants were aged ≥ 18 years.
Most participants (87%) used CGM with insulin pump therapy, 71% used sensors ≥ 75% of the time, and 66% received funding for CGM from the National Health Service. Four themes were identified: 1) metabolic control, 2) living with CGM (work and school, sleep, exercise, nutrition, frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG]), 3) psychological issues and patient/caregiver attitudes, and 4) barriers to CGM use (technical issues, financial issues, attitudes of healthcare professionals toward CGM). Despite some hassles, experiences were overwhelmingly positive, with improved glycemic control, diet and exercise management, quality of life, and physical and psychological well-being, as well as reduced frequency of SMBG. Technical problems included sensor inaccuracy and unreliability, and ""alarm fatigue."" The advantages of CGM used with an insulin pump with automatic suspension of insulin delivery during hypoglycemia were recorded by several participants, noting reduced hypoglycemia frequency and fear of nocturnal hypoglycemia.
Patient and caregiver narratives indicate that CGM is a valuable addition to diabetes care for many with type 1 diabetes.

Nationwide reduction in the frequency of severe hypoglycemia by half.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25528006/),"
To examine contemporary rates of severe hypoglycemia (SH) and identify the effect of predictors of SH in a pediatric type 1 diabetes population.
The national diabetes register provided data on children residing in Denmark from 2008 to 2013 in this register-based population study. Robust Poisson regression models were applied.
The study population [n = 2,715 (50.9 % boys), mean (SD) age at onset; 8.1 (4.0) years, diabetes duration; 5.6 (4.9) years] comprised 7,390 person-years of data and 561 events of SH. The overall incidence of SH was 7.6 per 100 person-years. The incidence rate peaked with 16.0 per 100 person-years in 2008 reaching a nadir of 4.9 in 2011. Overall, insulin pump reduced the rate of SH with 27 % compared to any pen treatment (P = 0.003). When stratifying pen treatment, premixed insulin increased the rate of SH by 1.9-fold (P = 0.0015) and NPH increased the rate by 1.6-fold (P = 0.003) versus pump treatment, whereas long-acting insulin analogues were comparable with pump treatment (P = 0.1485). We found no association of SH with glycemic control (P > 0.05).
A nationwide halving in rates of severe hypoglycemia was observed during the study period independent of the prevailing average HbA1c level. Changes in diabetes care and successful educational programs may have influenced the lower incidence rate of severe hypoglycemia.

Important determinants of diabetes control in insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25513744/),"
Insulin pumps are equipped with advanced functions. Intensive training and adherence are required for optimum use of the technology. We aimed to assess the association of various key elements in insulin pump functions on blood glucose control.
Patients on insulin pump therapy were enrolled. Insulin pumps were downloaded (CareLink(Â®) Pro 3 software; Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA), and data were collected over an 8-12-week period. Glycemic control of patients was classified as controlled (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level of 7.5% or less in adults and 8% or less in children) and uncontrolled based on HbA1c level at enrollment. Variables studied were use of sensors and duration, frequency of blood glucose monitoring, Bolus Wizard (Medtronic Minimed) use, frequency of correction boluses, and frequency of cannula changing.
Seventy-two patients were enrolled (50 children). Median age was 12 years for children and 27.5 years for adults. Respective median numbers of blood glucose checks were 4.4 and 3.2 for controlled and uncontrolled children (P<0.021) and 3.1 and 2.8 for controlled and uncontrolled adults, respectively. Respective frequency of Bolus Wizard use per day showed a median of 6 and 4.15 for controlled and uncontrolled children (P<0.001) and 3.8 and 3.5 for controlled and uncontrolled adults. Controlled children wore sensors for longer (5 vs. 2.9 days/week) and did more corrections (3.9 vs. 2.5). There was no difference in the frequency of changing the infusion cannula in children's or adults' groups.
We conclude that the frequency of blood glucose monitoring and Bolus Wizard use have a favorable association with glycemic control. These observations were more significant in the children's groups. Our data shows that patients with better control tend to bolus more for correction and wear sensors longer.

Bubble formation occurs in insulin pumps in response to changes in ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure but not as a result of vibration.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452873/),"
Bubble formation in insulin pump giving sets is a common problem. We studied change in temperature, change in atmospheric pressure, and vibration as potential mechanisms of bubble formation.
5 Animas 2020 pumps with 2 mL cartridges and Inset II infusion systems, 5 Medtronic Paradigm pumps with 1.8 mL cartridge and Quickset and 3 Roche Accu-chek pumps with 3.15 mL cartridges were used. Temperature study: insulin pumps were exposed to a temperature change from 4°C to 37°C. Pressure study: insulin pumps were taken to an altitude of 300 m. Vibration study: insulin pumps were vigorously shaken. All were observed for bubble formation.
Bubble formation was observed with changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure. Bubble formation did not occur with vibration.
Changes in insulin temperature and atmospheric pressure are common and may result in bubble formation. Vibration may distribute bubbles but does not cause bubble formation.

Assessing sensor accuracy for non-adjunct use of continuous glucose monitoring.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25436913/),"
The level of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) accuracy needed for insulin dosing using sensor values (i.e., the level of accuracy permitting non-adjunct CGM use) is a topic of ongoing debate. Assessment of this level in clinical experiments is virtually impossible because the magnitude of CGM errors cannot be manipulated and related prospectively to clinical outcomes.
A combination of archival data (parallel CGM, insulin pump, self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG] records, and meals for 56 pump users with type 1 diabetes) and in silico experiments was used to ""replay"" real-life treatment scenarios and relate sensor error to glycemic outcomes. Nominal blood glucose (BG) traces were extracted using a mathematical model, yielding 2,082 BG segments each initiated by insulin bolus and confirmed by SMBG. These segments were replayed at seven sensor accuracy levels (mean absolute relative differences [MARDs] of 3-22%) testing six scenarios: insulin dosing using sensor values, threshold, and predictive alarms, each without or with considering CGM trend arrows.
In all six scenarios, the occurrence of hypoglycemia (frequency of BG levels ≤50 mg/dL and BG levels ≤39 mg/dL) increased with sensor error, displaying an abrupt slope change at MARD =10%. Similarly, hyperglycemia (frequency of BG levels ≥250 mg/dL and BG levels ≥400 mg/dL) increased and displayed an abrupt slope change at MARD=10%. When added to insulin dosing decisions, information from CGM trend arrows, threshold, and predictive alarms resulted in improvement in average glycemia by 1.86, 8.17, and 8.88 mg/dL, respectively.
Using CGM for insulin dosing decisions is feasible below a certain level of sensor error, estimated in silico at MARD=10%. In our experiments, further accuracy improvement did not contribute substantively to better glycemic outcomes.

"Comparison of dual-hormone artificial pancreas, single-hormone artificial pancreas, and conventional insulin pump therapy for glycaemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes: an open-label randomised controlled crossover trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25434967/),"
The artificial pancreas is an emerging technology for the treatment of type 1 diabetes and two configurations have been proposed: single-hormone (insulin alone) and dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon). We aimed to delineate the usefulness of glucagon in the artificial pancreas system.
We did a randomised crossover trial of dual-hormone artificial pancreas, single-hormone artificial pancreas, and conventional insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) in participants aged 12 years or older with type 1 diabetes. Participants were assigned in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio with blocked randomisation to the three interventions and attended a research facility for three 24-h study visits. During visits when the patient used the single-hormone artificial pancreas, insulin was delivered based on glucose sensor readings and a predictive dosing algorithm. During dual-hormone artificial pancreas visits, glucagon was also delivered during low or falling glucose. During conventional insulin pump therapy visits, patients received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. The study was not masked. The primary outcome was the time for which plasma glucose concentrations were in the target range (4·0-10·0 mmol/L for 2 h postprandially and 4·0-8·0 mmol/L otherwise). Hypoglycaemic events were defined as plasma glucose concentration of less than 3·3 mmol/L with symptoms or less than 3·0 mmol/L irrespective of symptoms. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, in which we included data for all patients who completed at least two visits. A p value of less than 0·0167 (0·05/3) was regarded as significant. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01754337.
The mean proportion of time spent in the plasma glucose target range over 24 h was 62% (SD 18), 63% (18), and 51% (19) with single-hormone artificial pancreas, dual-hormone artificial pancreas, and conventional insulin pump therapy, respectively. The mean difference in time spent in the target range between single-hormone artificial pancreas and conventional insulin pump therapy was 11% (17; p=0·002) and between dual-hormone artificial pancreas and conventional insulin pump therapy was 12% (21; p=0·00011). There was no difference (15; p=0·75) in the proportion of time spent in the target range between the single-hormone and dual-hormone artificial pancreas systems. There were 52 hypoglycaemic events with conventional insulin pump therapy (12 of which were symptomatic), 13 with the single-hormone artificial pancreas (five of which were symptomatic), and nine with the dual-hormone artificial pancreas (0 of which were symptomatic); the number of nocturnal hypoglycaemic events was 13 (0 symptomatic), 0, and 0, respectively.
Single-hormone and dual-hormone artificial pancreas systems both provided better glycaemic control than did conventional insulin pump therapy. The single-hormone artificial pancreas might be sufficient for hypoglycaemia-free overnight glycaemic control.

Lipoatrophy in children with type 1 diabetes: an increasing incidence?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25411060/),"
The objectives were to evaluate the current prevalence of lipoatrophy at insulin injection sites in young patients with type 1 diabetes. Standardized examination of insulin injection sites in all 678 patients with type 1 diabetes treated in 2013 in our outpatient clinic were conducted. In case of lipoatrophy photo documentation and standardized interview with parents and patients were performed. We identified a total of 16 patients (43.8% male) with lipoatrophy (overall prevalence 2.4%). The current mean age (±SD) of the affected patients was 14.4 ± 3.9 years, age and diabetes duration at onset of lipoatrophy were 11.5 ± 3.8 years and 5.4 ± 3.6 years, respectively. All patients were using analogs at the onset of lipoatrophy. In all, 14 of 16 patients (87.5%) were on insulin pump compared with 52% without lipoatrophy (P = .0018). The use of steel needle and Teflon catheter was equal between the pump patients. Concomitant autoimmune diseases were present in 37.5% of the patients (thyroiditis: n = 3, thyroiditis and celiac disease: n = 2, celiac disease: n = 1) compared with 15.0% in those without lipoatrophy (P = .0128). Lipoatrophy was present in young patients treated with modern insulins and pumps; however, the prevalence was relatively low as expected with the use of modern insulins. Our data may support the hypothesis that a constant mechanical element such as a subcutaneous catheter may trigger the development of lipoatrophy, particularly in those patients with more than 1 autoimmune disease.

Insulin pump use and glycemic control in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: Predictors of change in method of insulin delivery across two years.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25387433/),"
Few studies have explored durability of insulin pump use, and none have explored the link between depression and pump discontinuation. To examine the relationship between depressive symptoms [measured by the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI)], method of insulin delivery, and hemoglobin A1c (A1c), mixed models were used with data from 150 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and visits every 6 months for 2 years. Of the 63% who used a pump, compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) at baseline, there were higher proportions who were non-minorities, had caregivers with a college degree, private insurance, and two caregivers in the home (p ≤ 0.01). After adjusting for time, sex, age, T1D duration, frequency of blood glucose monitoring, ethnicity, insurance, and caregiver number and education, baseline pump use was associated with -0.79% lower mean A1c [95% confidence interval (CI): -1.48, -0.096; p = 0.03]. For those using a pump at baseline, but switching to MDI during the study (n = 9), mean A1c was 1.38% higher (95% CI: 0.68, 2.08; p < 0.001) than that for those who did not switch method of delivery. A 10-point increase in CDI was associated with a 0.39% increase in A1c (95% CI: 0.16, 0.61; p = 0.001), independent of pump use. Regarding the temporal relationship between CDI score and changing method of insulin delivery, prior higher CDI score was associated with switching from pump to MDI (odds ratio = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.39; p = 0.007). Clinicians should be aware of the associations between depressive symptoms, change in insulin delivery method, and the effect on glycemic control.

Pitfalls of insulin pump clocks: technical glitches that may potentially affect medical care in patients with diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25355713/),"
The objective was to raise awareness about the importance of ensuring that insulin pumps internal clocks are set up correctly at all times. This is a very important safety issue because all commercially available insulin pumps are not GPS-enabled (though this is controversial), nor equipped with automatically adjusting internal clocks. Special attention is paid to how basal and bolus dose errors can be introduced by daylight savings time changes, travel across time zones, and am-pm clock errors. Correct setting of insulin pump internal clock is crucial for appropriate insulin delivery. A comprehensive literature review is provided, as are illustrative cases. Incorrect setting can potentially result in incorrect insulin delivery, with potential harmful consequences, if too much or too little insulin is delivered. Daylight saving time changes may not significantly affect basal insulin delivery, given the triviality of the time difference. However, bolus insulin doses can be dramatically affected. Such problems may occur when pump wearers have large variations in their insulin to carb ratio, especially if they forget to change their pump clock in the spring. More worrisome than daylight saving time change is the am-pm clock setting. If this setting is set up incorrectly, both basal rates and bolus doses will be affected. Appropriate insulin delivery through insulin pumps requires correct correlation between dose settings and internal clock time settings. Because insulin pumps are not GPS-enabled or automatically time-adjusting, extra caution should be practiced by patients to ensure correct time settings at all times. Clinicians and diabetes educators should verify the date/time of insulin pumps during patients' visits, and should remind their patients to always verify these settings.

Usability and training differences between two personal insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25316715/),"
The purpose of this study was to determine if there were usability and training differences between the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm Revel Insulin Pump and the Tandem Diabetes Care t:slim Insulin Pump during use by representative users, performing representative tasks, in a simulated use environment. This study utilized a between-subjects experimental design with a total of 72 participants from 5 sites across the United States. Study participants were randomized to either the Revel pump group or the t:slim Pump group. Participants were 18 years of age or older and managed their diabetes using multiple daily insulin injections. Dependent variables included training time, training satisfaction, time on task, task failures, System Usability Scale (SUS) ratings, perceived task difficulty, and a pump survey that measured different aspects of the pumps and training sessions. There was a statistically significant difference in training times and error rates between the t:slim and Revel groups. The training time difference represented a 27% reduction in time to train on the t:slim versus the Revel pump. There was a 65% reduction in participants' use error rates between the t:slim and the Revel group. The t:slim Pump had statistically significant training and usability advantages over the Revel pump. The reduction in training time may have been a result of an optimized information architecture, an intuitive navigational layout, and an easy-to-read screen. The reduction in use errors with the t:slim may have been a result of dynamic error handling and active confirmation screens, which may have prevented programming errors.

Do perceptions of insulin pump usability impact attitudes toward insulin pump therapy? A pilot study of individuals with type 1 and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25269659/),"
We assessed the impact of perceived insulin pump usability on attitudes toward insulin pump therapy in diabetic individuals currently treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). This comparative, single-arm study recruited 28 adults with type 1 (n = 16) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (n = 12) to evaluate 2 current insulin pumps: Medtronic Revel 723 (Pump 1), Asante Snap Insulin Pump (Pump 2). Participants were randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 assessment sequences: Pump 1 followed by Pump 2; and Pump 2 followed by Pump 1. Structured observational protocols were utilized to assess participants' ability and time required to learn/perform common tasks associated with pump setup/use. Participants used a modified version of the System Usability Scale (SUS) and investigator-developed questionnaires to rate pump usability and task difficulty; pre-post questionnaires assessed changes in attitudes toward insulin pump therapy. All participants completed the study. SUS scores showed Pump 2 to be more usable than Pump 1 on all usability attributes. Participants rated Pump 2 more positively than Pump 1, overall mean SUS scores of 5.7 versus 4.1 respectively, F(1, 52) = 32.7, P < .001, and SUS scores were higher if participants used the Pump 2 last, 5.3 versus 4.4 for Pump 1 last, F(1, 52) = 10.8, P < .01. Pump 2 was preferred for all tasks: manual bolus (86%), bolus calculation (71%), managing basal rates (93%), interpreting alarms (96%), transferring settings (100%), changing insulin and infusion sets (93%), all P < .05. Perceptions of pump usability can directly impact acceptance and use of features that may benefit those who wear them. Simpler pump devices that decrease perceptions of complexity may encourage broader use of this technology.

The impact of accelerometer use in exercise-associated hypoglycemia prevention in type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25231116/),"
Exercise-associated hypoglycemia is a common adverse event in people with type 1 diabetes. Previous in silico testing by our group demonstrated superior exercise-associated hypoglycemia mitigation when a predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) algorithm was augmented to incorporate activity data. The current study investigates the effectiveness of an accelerometer-augmented PLGS algorithm in an outpatient exercise protocol. Subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy participated in two structured soccer sessions, one utilizing the algorithm and the other using the subject's regular basal insulin rate. Each subject wore their own insulin pump and a Dexcom G4™ Platinum continuous glucose monitor (CGM); subjects on-algorithm also wore a Zephyr BioHarness™ 3 accelerometer. The algorithm utilized a Kalman filter with a 30-minute prediction horizon. Activity and CGM readings were manually entered into a spreadsheet and at five-minute intervals, the algorithm indicated whether the basal insulin infusion should be on or suspended; any changes were then implemented by study staff. The rate of hypoglycemia during and after exercise (until the following morning) was compared between groups. Eighteen subjects (mean age 13.4 ± 3.7 years) participated in two separate sessions 7-22 days apart. The difference in meter blood glucose levels between groups at each rest period did not achieve statistical significance at any time point. Hypoglycemia during the session was recorded in three on-algorithm subjects, compared to six off-algorithm subjects. In the postexercise monitoring period, hypoglycemia occurred in two subjects who were on-algorithm during the session and four subjects who were off-algorithm. The accelerometer-augmented algorithm failed to prevent exercise-associated hypoglycemia compared to subjects on their usual basal rates. A larger sample size may have achieved statistical significance. Further research involving an automated system, a larger sample size, and an algorithm design that favors longer periods of pump suspension is necessary.

Assessing the effectiveness of 3 months day and night home closed-loop insulin delivery in adults with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes: a randomised crossover study protocol.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25186158/),"
Despite therapeutic advances, many people with type 1 diabetes are still unable to achieve optimal glycaemic control, limited by the occurrence of hypoglycaemia. The objective of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of day and night home closed-loop over the medium term compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes and suboptimal glycaemic control.
The study will adopt an open label, three-centre, multinational, randomised, two-period crossover study design comparing automated closed-loop glucose control with sensor augmented insulin pump therapy. The study will aim for 30 completed participants. Eligible participants will be adults (≥18 years) with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy and suboptimal glycaemic control (glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)≥7.5% (58 mmol/mmol) and ≤10% (86 mmol/mmol)). Following a 4-week optimisation period, participants will undergo a 3-month use of automated closed-loop insulin delivery and sensor-augmented pump therapy, with a 4-6 week washout period in between. The order of the interventions will be random. All analysis will be conducted on an intention to treat basis. The primary outcome is the time spent in the target glucose range from 3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L based on continuous glucose monitoring levels during the 3 months free living phase. Secondary outcomes include HbA1c changes; mean glucose and time spent above and below target glucose levels. Further, participants will be invited at baseline, midpoint and study end to participate in semistructured interviews and complete questionnaires to explore usability and acceptance of the technology, impact on quality of life and fear of hypoglycaemia.
Ethical approval has been obtained at all sites. Before screening, all participants will be provided with oral and written information about the trial. The study will be disseminated by peer-review publications and conference presentations.

Can integrated technology improve self-care behavior in youth with type 1 diabetes? A randomized crossover trial of automated pump function.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25172877/),"
Automated blood glucose (BG) and insulin pump systems allow wireless transmission of all BG readings to a user's pump. This study aimed to assess whether use of such a system, as compared with a manual BG entry insulin pump, resulted in higher mean daily frequency of BGs recorded after 6 months. A 12-month randomized crossover trial, comprising 2 phases, was conducted. All participants used insulin pump devices with automated vs manual BG entry for 6 months each; order of system use was randomly assigned. Device interactions were assessed from pump and glucometer downloads. Thirty-five participants were enrolled; 9 withdrew during the study. Use of the automated insulin pump system resulted in higher mean daily BG recorded over 6 months of use when compared to a manual BG entry system (5.8 ± 1.7 vs 5.0 ± 1.9; P = .02 [95% confidence interval, 0.14 to 1.58]). Bolus frequency was similar between groups. No HbA1c difference was observed between groups at 6 months (8.0% [64 mmol/l] ± 1.3 automated vs 7.7% [61 mmol/l] ± 0.9 manual; P = .38). Post hoc analysis demonstrated improved ΔHbA1c with automated system use in an adolescent subgroup with suboptimal baseline BG frequency (-0.9% vs + 0.5%; P = .003). Use of an automated glucometer/insulin pump resulted in higher number of BGs recorded over 6 months when compared to an insulin pump with manual BG entry. This may be especially beneficial for adolescent manual system users who enter <5 BGs per day into their pump.

The effectiveness and durability of an early insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25162664/),"
This study evaluated the predictors of effectiveness and durability of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents who have initiated continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) within 2 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
The charts of individuals with T1DM using insulin pumps who were treated at our center were reviewed, including subjects with age at onset of <22 years, interval between onset and insulin pump commencement (interval onset-commencement) of <2 years, use of pumps of >1 year, and use of glucose sensors for <4 weeks/year. The primary end point was the mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) value (MHbA1c) throughout the follow-up.
From 684 patients treated with insulin pumps, 119 met the inclusion criteria, and 113 were selected for statistical analysis (60 females; age at diabetes onset, 8.9±5.6 years [mean±SD]; follow-up, 4.0±1.8 years; range, 1-8 years; baseline HbA1c, 9.3±1.8%). Only the interval onset-commencement was a linear predictor of the MHbA1c (P=0.01; R(2)=0.089). A significant reduction of the mean yearly HbA1c from baseline throughout all the follow-up was observed (P<0.001). Categorizing the sample into four quartiles on the basis of an increasing interval onset-commencement resulted in levels of MHbA1c significantly lower in the first and second quartiles in comparison with the fourth quartile (7.6±0.8% and 7.8±1.0%, respectively, versus 8.5±0.8%; P<0.001 and P=0.004, respectively).
The present study suggests that early pump commencement in children and adolescents with T1DM provides lower and more durable HbA1c values than a late commencement. It is possible that an early pump commencement could prolong the honeymoon phase, but we cannot confirm or exclude this hypothesis because the lack of data about C-peptide levels during the follow-up.

A cost-effectiveness analysis of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and automated insulin suspension versus standard pump therapy for hypoglycemic unaware patients with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25128049/),"
To assess the cost-effectiveness of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with ""Low Glucose Suspend"" (LGS) functionality versus standard pump therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes who have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia.
A clinical trial-based economic evaluation was performed in which the net costs and effectiveness of the two treatment modalities were calculated and expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The clinical outcome of interest for the evaluation was the rate of severe hypoglycemia in each arm of the LGS study. Quality-of-life utility scores were calculated using the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire. Resource use costs were estimated using public sources.
After 6 months, the use of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS significantly reduced the incidence of severe hypoglycemia compared with standard pump therapy (incident rate difference 1.85 [0.17-3.53]; P = 0.037). Based on a primary randomized study, the ICER per severe hypoglycemic event avoided was $18,257 for all patients and $14,944 for those aged 12 years and older. Including all major medical resource costs (e.g., hospital admissions), the ICERs were $17,602 and $14,289, respectively. Over the 6-month period, the cost per quality-adjusted life-year gained was $40,803 for patients aged 12 years and older.
Based on the Australian experience evaluating new interventions across a broad range of therapeutic areas, sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with LGS may be considered a cost-effective alternative to standard pump therapy with self-monitoring of blood glucose in hypoglycemia unaware patients with type 1 diabetes.

Management of insulin pump therapy in children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25125555/),"
Insulin pump therapy is a current treatment option for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Insulin pumps can provide a greater flexibility in insulin administration and meal planning, as compared with multiple insulin injections, and they may be particularly suitable for the paediatric age group. Many young people with diabetes have integrated insulin pumps into their daily practice. The use of insulin pumps can also be supplemented by the information retrieved from continuous glucose monitoring in the sensor-augmented pump therapy, which may improve glycaemic control. In this review, we describe the principles of pump therapy and summarise features of commercially available insulin pumps, with focus on practical management and the advantages and disadvantages of this technology.

Insulin pump therapy: impact on the lives of children/young people with diabetes mellitus and their parents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25108411/),"
Advances in medical technology and research documenting clinical effectiveness have led to the increased use of insulin pumps worldwide. However, their use by children in the UK is relatively limited and there is little evidence regarding their impact on patients' lives.
This study aimed to examine the impact of switching from multiple daily injections to insulin pumps on the glycaemic control and daily lives of children/young people and their families.
University College London Hospital, London.
Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with children/young people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (5-17 years; N = 34) and their parents (N = 38), receiving insulin pump therapy and attending paediatric diabetes outpatients clinics at a major university teaching hospital in London. Glycated haemoglobin A1c values from 6 months prior to, and after pump therapy were obtained. Qualitative and quantitative approaches were undertaken for data analysis.
Glycated haemoglobin A1c and the impact of the use of insulin pumps on the children and their families.
The majority of parents (N = 32) and the children/young people (N = 30) reported that glycaemic control was easier to maintain within the target range with pumps compared to injections. This was supported by glycated haemoglobin A1c measures. Participants generally found the devices easy to use and more acceptable than injections. However, parents and children/young people reported many challenges in the early stages of pump therapy (e.g. 7 children/young had worse control at 6 months after starting CSII). Parents and children/young people reported an overall increase in lifestyle flexibility and an improved ability to participate in home, school and social activities whilst maintaining glycaemic control.
Administration of insulin via pumps rather than injections was generally preferred. Participants reported most difficulty at the commencement of use. Pump therapy conferred benefits in terms of glycaemic control, general well-being, enabling young people to be more in control of their condition and live more normal lives, as reported by most participants. These are important goals of health policy for children/young people with long-term conditions in the UK.

Clinical evaluation of the use of a multifunctional remotely controlled insulin pump: multicenter observational study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25107708/),"
Current insulin pumps now feature advanced functions for calculating insulin dosages, delivering insulin and analyzing data, however, the perceived usefulness of these functions in clinical settings has not been well studied. We assessed the use and patient perceptions of an insulin delivery system (Accu-Chek® Combo, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) that combines an insulin pump and a handheld multifunctional blood glucose meter with integrated remote control functions. This prospective, observational, multicenter study enrolled 74 type 1 diabetes patients within 13 weeks after starting use of the pump system. At 4 to 24 weeks, investigators collected usage data from the latest 14-day period. Seventy-two patients completed the evaluation, aged 39 ± 15 years, diabetes duration 16 ± 13 years, HbA1c 8.3 ± 1.6%. At follow-up, 62 (86.1%) patients used the remote control for ≥50% of all boluses, 20 (27.8%) used the bolus advisor for ≥50% of all boluses, and 42 (58.3%) viewed at least 1 of the e-logbook reports. More than 95% of users appraised the functions as easy-to-use and useful; median scores from VAS (0 = useless to 100 = indispensable) ranged from 72 to 85. A high percentage of study patients used the system's advanced features, especially the remote control feature for bolusing. Overall, patients assessed the functions as useful and easy to use. Results support the implementation of these smart capabilities in further insulin pump developments.

"Insulin pump treatment; increasing prevalence, and predictors for better metabolic outcome in Danish children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25082292/),"
Few studies have looked at nationwide data for insulin pump treatment. Since 1996 the Danish Childhood Diabetes Registry (DanDiabKids) has collected data on all Danish diabetic patients aged 0-15 yr. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) use among Danish children with diabetes and to compare metabolic control in CSII-treated children and adolescents to those treated with MDI.
The Registry collects on a yearly basis data on insulin regimen, central measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), and demographic data on all patients. In the period 2005-2011, 2983 young patients (1721 males) with diabetes were followed in the Registry. Mean observation period was 5.11 yr [standard error (SE) 0.09]. In the total period 1846 patients were treated with MDI and 1493 changed from MDI to CSII. In 2005, less than 5% of children were treated with CSII whereas the percentage of children on CSII increased to approximately 50% in 2011. The patients were divided into age groups, <5 yr, 5-10 yr, and > 15 yr.
HbA1c was significantly higher in MDI-treated children, +5.29 (CI 95% 4.29; 6.29 mmol/mol). HbA1c in all age groups was significantly lower in CSII-treated patients, and longitudinally HbA1c continued to be lower in all age groups. In multivariate analysis, a low HbA1c at CSII start, centers with more than 100 pump patients, a more recent year of diabetes onset, a higher number of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) measurements, a higher number of daily boluses, and a higher percentage of bolus insulin were all related to a lower HbA1c.
The percentage of children on pumps (CSII) is CSII treatment is associated with a significantly lower Hba1c, achieved just after treatment initiation. In the following years there is a parallel rise in HbA1c in both MDI as well as in MDI treated patients. Patients coming from larger clinics, and patients measuring more blood glucose values and taking more boluses have a better metabolic control.

Accuracy of a new patch pump based on a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) compared to other commercially available insulin pumps: results of the first in vitro and in vivo studies.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25079676/),"
The JewelPUMP™ (JP) is a new patch pump based on a microelectromechanical system that operates without any plunger. The study aimed to evaluate the infusion accuracy of the JP in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro studies, commercially available pumps meeting the ISO standard were compared to the JP: the MiniMed® Paradigm® 712 (MP), Accu-Chek® Combo (AC), OmniPod® (OP), Animas® Vibe™ (AN). Pump accuracy was measured over 24 hours using a continuous microweighing method, at 0.1 and 1 IU/h basal rates. The occlusion alarm threshold was measured after a catheter occlusion. The JP, filled with physiological serum, was then tested in 13 patients with type 1 diabetes simultaneously with their own pump for 2 days. The weight difference was used to calculate the infused insulin volume. The JP showed reduced absolute median error rate in vitro over a 15-minute observation window compared to other pumps (1 IU/h): ±1.02% (JP) vs ±1.60% (AN), ±1.66% (AC), ±2.22% (MP), and ±4.63% (OP), P < .0001. But there was no difference over 24 hours. At 0.5 IU/h, the JP was able to detect an occlusion earlier than other pumps: 21 (19; 25) minutes vs 90 (85; 95), 58 (42; 74), and 143 (132; 218) minutes (AN, AC, MP), P < .05 vs AN and MP. In patients, the 24-hour flow error was not significantly different between the JP and usual pumps (-2.2 ± 5.6% vs -0.37 ± 4.0%, P = .25). The JP was found to be easier to wear than conventional pumps. The JP is more precise over a short time period, more sensitive to catheter occlusion, well accepted by patients, and consequently, of potential interest for a closed-loop insulin delivery system.

Prevalence and predictors of severe hypoglycemia in Danish children and adolescents with diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25039921/),"
To investigate the prevalence of severe hypoglycemia in Danish children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to pinpoint predictors of this acute complication in children on modern treatment modalities.
The study is based on data from DanDiabKids, a national diabetes register for children and adolescents. The register contains data on patients with type 1 diabetes with an ascertainment rate of 99%. Data from 3320 patients aged 0-18 yr was included in the study period from 1998 to 2009 and analyzed using a negative binomial model.
One thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine episodes of severe hypoglycemia in 867 patients were registered conferring an overall incidence of severe hypoglycemia of 15.1 [95% confident interval (CI): 13.8; 16.4] per 100 patient years. This remained unchanged during the study period. Duration of diabetes, age and treatment in centers managing less than 100 patients significantly increased the risk of severe hypoglycemia (p < 0.001). Patients on insulin pump therapy had a 42% reduced risk of severe hypoglycemia compared with pen treated patients (p = 0.01). Patients treated with five or more daily insulin injections had a 31% (95% CI: 17; 49) reduced risk of severe hypoglycemia compared to patients on fewer daily injections (p = 0.015).
Despite improvements in metabolic control over a decade the prevalence of severe hypoglycemic events remained unchanged. More intensive treatments such as insulin pump therapy and multiple daily injections on a national level seems to be a protective factor for developing severe hypoglycemia up to 2009.

"The JDRF CCTN CGM TIME Trial: Timing of Initiation of continuous glucose Monitoring in Established pediatric type 1 diabetes: study protocol, recruitment and baseline characteristics.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25034216/),"
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to improve glucose control in adults with type 1 diabetes. Effectiveness of CGM is directly linked with CGM adherence, which can be challenging to maintain in children and adolescents. We hypothesize that initiating CGM at the same time as starting insulin pump therapy in pump naïve children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes will result in greater CGM adherence and effectiveness compared to delaying CGM introduction by 6 months, and that this is related to greater readiness for making behaviour change at the time of pump initiation.
The CGM TIME Trial is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Eligible children and adolescents (5-18 years) with established type 1 diabetes were randomized to simultaneous initiation of pump (Medtronic Veo©) and CGM (Enlite©) or to standard pump therapy with delayed CGM introduction. Primary outcomes are CGM adherence and hemoglobin A1C at 6 and 12 months post pump initiation. Secondary outcomes include glycemic variability, stage of readiness, and other patient-reported outcomes with follow-up to 24 months. 144 (95%) of the 152 eligible patients were enrolled and randomized. Allowing for 10% withdrawals, this will provide 93% power to detect a between group difference in CGM adherence and 86% power to detect a between group difference in hemoglobin A1C. Baseline characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. Analysis of 12 month primary outcomes will begin in September 2014.
The CGM TIME Trial is the first study to examine the relationship between timing of CGM initiation, readiness for behaviour change, and subsequent CGM adherence in pump naïve children and adolescents. Its findings will advance our understanding of when and how to initiate CGM in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

The management of type 1 diabetes in Australian primary schools.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25007139/),"
The aim of this study was to explore the management of type 1 diabetes in Australian primary schools: kindergarten-Year 2, from the parent's perspective. The study questions were: What diabetes treatment is being delivered? Who is providing the treatment? Where is the treatment given?
A cross sectional, descriptive approach was used to collect data from parents (66) of children with type 1 diabetes attending an Australian primary school (kindergarten-Year 2). An online self-administered questionnaire was designed in Survey Monkey and was available via a dedicated Facebook page. Data were analysed using statistical analysis (SPSSv21).
Blood glucose testing was occurring for all children, with 49% of children self testing. 77% of children were receiving an insulin bolus or injection at school. 34% was provided by the child and 53% of insulin was given via pump. Teachers, parents and teacher's aides also provided insulin at school. There was a statistically significant association between the number of children receiving insulin at school and the insulin delivery device, χ(2 )= 16.75, df = 1, p ≤ 0.000). Children using insulin pump therapy were more likely (97%) to receive insulin at school than children who used injections (55%). Children who were able to self-administer insulin were more likely to receive insulin (93%) at school than children who were unable to self-administer insulin (65%) (χ(2 )= 7.38, df = 1, p = 0.007) 81% of children received diabetes treatment in the classroom, with the remainder in the school administration office.
Insulin administration across Australian primary schools was inconsistent. Not all children were receiving the recommended insulin treatment. Insulin pump therapy appears to increase access to this treatment at school.

Insulin pump treatment compared with multiple daily injections for treatment of type 2 diabetes (OpT2mise): a randomised open-label controlled trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24998009/),"
Many patients with advanced type 2 diabetes do not meet their glycated haemoglobin targets and randomised controlled studies comparing the efficacy of pump treatment and multiple daily injections for lowering glucose in insulin-treated patients have yielded inconclusive results. We aimed to resolve this uncertainty with a randomised controlled trial (OpT2mise).
We did this multicentre, controlled trial at 36 hospitals, tertiary care centres, and referal centres in Canada, Europe, Israel, South Africa, and the USA. Patients with type 2 diabetes who had poor glycaemic control despite multiple daily injections with insulin analogues were enrolled into a 2-month dose-optimisation run-in period. After the run-in period, patients with glycated haemoglobin of 8·0-12·0% (64-108 mmol/mol) were randomly assigned (1:1) by a computer-generated randomisation sequence (block size 2 with probability 0·75 and size 4 with probability 0·25) to pump treatment or to continue with multiple daily injections. Neither patients nor investigators were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was change in mean glycated haemoglobin between baseline and end of the randomised phase for the intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01182493.
495 of 590 screened patients entered the run-in phase and 331 were randomised (168 to pump treatment, 163 to multiple daily injections). Mean glycated haemoglobin at baseline was 9% (75 mmol/mol) in both groups. At 6 months, mean glycated haemoglobin had decreased by 1·1% (SD 1·2; 12 mmol/mol, SD 13) in the pump treatment group and 0·4% (SD 1·1; 4 mmol/mol, SD 12) in the multiple daily injection group, resulting in a between-group treatment difference of -0·7% (95% CI -0·9 to -0·4; -8 mmol/mol, 95% CI -10 to -4, p<0·0001). At the end of the study, the mean total daily insulin dose was 97 units (SD 56) with pump treatment versus 122 units (SD 68) for multiple daily injections (p<0·0001), with no significant difference in bodyweight change between the two groups (1·5 kg [SD 3·5] vs 1·1 kg [3·6], p=0·322). Two diabetes-related serious adverse events (hyperglycaemia or ketosis without acidosis) resulting in hospital admission occurred in the pump treatment group compared with one in the multiple daily injection group. No ketoacidosis occurred in either group and one episode of severe hypoglycaemia occurred in the multiple daily injection group.
In patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes despite using multiple daily injections of insulin, pump treatment can be considered as a safe and valuable treatment option.

Why is insulin pump treatment rarely used in adolescents and young adults with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24984902/),"
In type 1 diabetes (T1D), the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has increased steadily in the last years. Compared with conventional insulin injection regimes, major advantages might be a nearly physiological insulin secretion, lower rates of hypoglycemia, higher flexibility in daily life, and increased quality of life. Data on CSII in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) are scarce.
To analyze current use of insulin pumps in CFRD and compare demographics of pump-treated patients between CFRD and T1D.
Data from the prospective German/Austrian diabetes patient registry on insulin-treated patients with either CFRD (n = 515) or T1D (n = 43 165) aged >10 yr at manifestation of diabetes were analyzed.
A total of 4.1% (n = 21) of CFRD and 17.7% (n = 7647) of T1D patients received insulin pump treatment within the recent year of care (p < 0.001). Pump-treated patients with CFRD had a significantly shorter duration of diabetes [median (Q1 ; Q3 ): 5.8 (2.9; 9.5) vs. 7.8 (4.3; 20.4) yr, p = 0.026] and tended to be younger [22.0 (18.2; 30.1) vs. 24.9 (17.3; 45.9) yr] than pump-treated T1D patients. Age at initiation of CSII seemed to be lower in CFRD [19.2 (16.5; 29.2) vs. 23.3 (14.8; 43.5) yr]. Insulin pump therapy was used slightly more often in male CFRD patients than females (4.7 vs. 3.6%), whereas in T1D the opposite was observed (14.9 vs. 21.2%, p < 0.001). Discontinuation rate of CSII was higher in CFRD than T1D (30.0 vs. 12.7%, p = 0.005).
Despite potential advantages, insulin pump therapy was rarely used among adolescent and young adult CFRD patients.

Effects of pump versus twice-daily injection delivery of synthetic parathyroid hormone 1-34 in children with severe congenital hypoparathyroidism.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24948345/),"
To compare the response with synthetic human parathyroid hormone (PTH) 1-34 delivered by twice-daily injection vs insulin pump in children with severe congenital hypoparathyroidism due to calcium receptor mutation or autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1.
Children and young adults aged 7-20 years with congenital hypoparathyroidism (N = 12) were randomized to receive PTH 1-34, delivered either by twice-daily subcutaneous injection or insulin pump for 13 weeks, followed by crossover to the opposite delivery method. The principal outcome measures were serum and urine calcium levels. Secondary outcomes included serum and urine magnesium and phosphate levels and bone turnover markers.
PTH 1-34 delivered via pump produced near normalization of mean serum calcium (2.02 ± 0.05 [pump] vs 1.88 ± 0.03 [injection] mmol/L, P < .05, normal 2.05-2.5 mmol/L), normalized mean urine calcium excretion (5.17 ± 1.10 [pump] vs 6.67 ± 0.76 mmol/24 h/1.73 m(2), P = .3), and significantly reduced markers of bone turnover (P < .02). Serum and urine calcium and magnesium showed a biphasic pattern during twice-daily injection vs minimal fluctuation during pump delivery. The PTH 1-34 dosage was markedly reduced during pump delivery (0.32 ± 0.04 vs 0.85 ± 0.11 μg/kg/d, P < .001), and magnesium supplements were also reduced (P < .001).
Compared with twice-daily delivery, pump delivery of PTH 1-34 provides more physiologic calcium homeostasis and bone turnover in children with severe congenital hypoparathyroidism.

Outpatient glycemic control with a bionic pancreas in type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24931572/),"
The safety and effectiveness of automated glycemic management have not been tested in multiday studies under unrestricted outpatient conditions.
In two random-order, crossover studies with similar but distinct designs, we compared glycemic control with a wearable, bihormonal, automated, ""bionic"" pancreas (bionic-pancreas period) with glycemic control with an insulin pump (control period) for 5 days in 20 adults and 32 adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. The automatically adaptive algorithm of the bionic pancreas received data from a continuous glucose monitor to control subcutaneous delivery of insulin and glucagon.
Among the adults, the mean plasma glucose level over the 5-day bionic-pancreas period was 138 mg per deciliter (7.7 mmol per liter), and the mean percentage of time with a low glucose level (<70 mg per deciliter [3.9 mmol per liter]) was 4.8%. After 1 day of automatic adaptation by the bionic pancreas, the mean (±SD) glucose level on continuous monitoring was lower than the mean level during the control period (133±13 vs. 159±30 mg per deciliter [7.4±0.7 vs. 8.8±1.7 mmol per liter], P<0.001) and the percentage of time with a low glucose reading was lower (4.1% vs. 7.3%, P=0.01). Among the adolescents, the mean plasma glucose level was also lower during the bionic-pancreas period than during the control period (138±18 vs. 157±27 mg per deciliter [7.7±1.0 vs. 8.7±1.5 mmol per liter], P=0.004), but the percentage of time with a low plasma glucose reading was similar during the two periods (6.1% and 7.6%, respectively; P=0.23). The mean frequency of interventions for hypoglycemia among the adolescents was lower during the bionic-pancreas period than during the control period (one per 1.6 days vs. one per 0.8 days, P<0.001).
As compared with an insulin pump, a wearable, automated, bihormonal, bionic pancreas improved mean glycemic levels, with less frequent hypoglycemic episodes, among both adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Safety of outpatient closed-loop control: first randomized crossover trials of a wearable artificial pancreas.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24929429/),"
We estimate the effect size of hypoglycemia risk reduction on closed-loop control (CLC) versus open-loop (OL) sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in supervised outpatient setting.
Twenty patients with type 1 diabetes initiated the study at the Universities of Virginia, Padova, and Montpellier and Sansum Diabetes Research Institute; 18 completed the entire protocol. Each patient participated in two 40-h outpatient sessions, CLC versus OL, in randomized order. Sensor (Dexcom G4) and insulin pump (Tandem t:slim) were connected to Diabetes Assistant (DiAs)-a smartphone artificial pancreas platform. The patient operated the system through the DiAs user interface during both CLC and OL; study personnel supervised on site and monitored DiAs remotely. There were no dietary restrictions; 45-min walks in town and restaurant dinners were included in both CLC and OL; alcohol was permitted.
The primary outcome-reduction in risk for hypoglycemia as measured by the low blood glucose (BG) index (LGBI)-resulted in an effect size of 0.64, P = 0.003, with a twofold reduction of hypoglycemia requiring carbohydrate treatment: 1.2 vs. 2.4 episodes/session on CLC versus OL (P = 0.02). This was accompanied by a slight decrease in percentage of time in the target range of 3.9-10 mmol/L (66.1 vs. 70.7%) and increase in mean BG (8.9 vs. 8.4 mmol/L; P = 0.04) on CLC versus OL.
CLC running on a smartphone (DiAs) in outpatient conditions reduced hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia treatments when compared with sensor-augmented pump therapy. This was accompanied by marginal increase in average glycemia resulting from a possible overemphasis on hypoglycemia safety.

"Contrasting the clinical care and outcomes of 2,622 children with type 1 diabetes less than 6 years of age in the United States T1D Exchange and German/Austrian DPV registries.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24893863/),"
The study aimed to compare participant characteristics, treatment modalities and clinical outcomes in registry participants less than 6 years old.
Participant characteristics, treatment modalities and clinical outcomes (HbA1c, severe hypoglycaemia [SH] and diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA]) as well as frequencies of attaining HbA1c goals in line with the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (<7.5% [<58 mmol/mol]) and ADA (<8.5% [<69 mmol/mol]) were compared.
Insulin pump use was more frequent (74% vs 50%, p < 0.001) and HbA1c levels lower in the Prospective Diabetes Follow-up Registry (DPV) than in the T1D Exchange (T1DX) (mean 7.4% vs 8.2%, p < 0.001). A lower HbA1c level was seen in the DPV compared with the T1DX for both pump users (p < 0.001) and injection users (p < 0.001). More children from DPV were meeting the recommended HbA1c goals, compared with children from T1DX (HbA1c <7.5%: 56% vs 22%, p < 0.001; HbA1c <8.5%: 90% vs 66%, p < 0.001). The adjusted odds of having an HbA1c level <7.5% or <8.5% were 4.2 (p < 0.001) and 3.6 (p < 0.001) higher for the DPV than the T1DX, respectively. The frequency of SH did not differ between registries or by HbA1c, whereas the frequency of DKA was higher for the T1DX and greater in those with higher HbA1c levels.
DPV data indicate that an HbA1c of <7.5% can frequently be achieved in children with type 1 diabetes who are under 6 years old. An improved metabolic control of type 1 diabetes in young patients appears to decrease the risk of DKA without increasing SH. The greater frequency of suboptimal control in young patients in the T1DX compared with the DPV is not fully explained by a less frequent use of insulin pumps and may relate to the higher HbA1c targets that are recommended for this age group in the USA.

Lessons learned from a pilot RCT of simultaneous versus delayed initiation of continuous glucose monitoring in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes starting insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876616/),"
Uncertainty remains about effectiveness of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D). Success with CGM is related to CGM adherence, which may relate to readiness to make the behavior changes required for effective use. We hypothesize that readiness for change will be greater at initiation of insulin pump therapy than in established pump users, and that this will predict CGM adherence. Our objective was to evaluate the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in children with established T1D comparing simultaneous pump and CGM initiation to standard pump therapy with delayed CGM initiation. We randomized participants to simultaneous pump and CGM initiation or to standard pump therapy with the option of adding CGM 4 months later. CGM adherence was tracked via web-based download and readiness for change assessed with the SOCRATES questionnaire. Of 41 eligible children, 20 agreed to participate; 15 subjects completed the study (7 males; baseline age 11.8 ± 4.0 years; T1D duration 2.7 ± 2.7 years; mean A1C 8.2 ± 0.8%). Six of 8 simultaneous group subjects used CGM > 60% of the time for 4 months compared to 1 of 7 delayed group subjects (P = .02). Using SOCRATES, we could assign 87-100% of subjects to a single motivation stage at baseline and 4 months. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of randomizing pump naïve children and adolescents with established T1D to simultaneous pump and CGM initiation versus standard pump therapy with delayed CGM initiation. Lessons from this pilot study were used to inform development of a full-scale multicenter RCT.

Insulin pump patient characteristics and glucose control in the hospitalized setting.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876608/),"
Patients' knowledge of their insulin pumps and glucose control during hospitalization has not been studied. The aim was to study the determinants of glycemic control in patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in the hospital. Three groups of patients were identified: those who did not need any inpatient education and continued on CSII (gorup A), those who received education then continued on CSII (group B), and those for whom CSII was not appropriate and were treated with multiple daily insulin injections (gorup C). We compared the measures of glycemic control between the 3 groups and analyzed which variables impacted glucose control. There were 50 patients, with 51 hospital admissions, 57% males, mean age 48 ± 13 years, 86% had type 1 diabetes (T1DM). The mean DM duration was 26 ± 14 years, mean duration of CSII use was 8.7 ± 6 years, and mean HbA1c was 7.6 ± 1.4%. The mean duration of hospital stay was 5.6 ± 4.6 days. Mean blood glucose (BG) and frequency of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemic events among the 3 groups adjusted for their duration of hospital stay were not statistically different. None of the patients developed diabetic ketoacidosis while using their pump. Stepwise multivariate analysis revealed knowledge of hypoglycemia correction was the single most important predictor of mean BG (P < .001). Patients who received inpatient education performed similarly to patients who did not need inpatient education. Patients who receive inpatient education on CSII fare similar as patients who did not require inpatient education.

Recommendations for Insulin Dose Calculator Risk Management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876550/),"
Several studies have shown the usefulness of an automated insulin dose bolus advisor (BA) in achieving improved glycemic control for insulin-using diabetes patients. Although regulatory agencies have approved several BAs over the past decades, these devices are not standardized in their approach to dosage calculation and include many features that may introduce risk to patients. Moreover, there is no single standard of care for diabetes worldwide and no guidance documents for BAs, specifically. Given the emerging and more stringent regulations on software used in medical devices, the approval process is becoming more difficult for manufacturers to navigate, with some manufacturers opting to remove BAs from their products altogether. A comprehensive literature search was performed, including publications discussing: diabetes BA use and benefit, infusion pump safety and regulation, regulatory submissions, novel BAs, and recommendations for regulation and risk management of BAs. Also included were country-specific and international guidance documents for medical device, infusion pump, medical software, and mobile medical application risk management and regulation. No definitive worldwide guidance exists regarding risk management requirements for BAs, specifically. However, local and international guidance documents for medical devices, infusion pumps, and medical device software offer guidance that can be applied to this technology. In addition, risk management exercises that are algorithm-specific can help prepare manufacturers for regulatory submissions. This article discusses key issues relevant to BA use and safety, and recommends risk management activities incorporating current research and guidance.

The Impact of Accelerometer and Heart Rate Data on Hypoglycemia Mitigation in Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876539/),"
Aerobic exercise can lower blood glucose levels and alter insulin sensitivity both during and several hours after exercise, creating challenges for a closed-loop artificial pancreas. Predictive low glucose suspend (PLGS) algorithms are a first step toward an artificial pancreas, but few of these have been successfully applied to exercise. This study incorporates physical activity measurements from a combined accelerometer/heart rate monitor (HRM) to improve the performance of an existing PLGS algorithm at mitigating exercise-associated hypoglycemia in participants with type 1 diabetes. In all, 22 subjects with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy were provided a combined accelerometer/HRM and (if not already using one) a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), then instructed to go about their everyday lives while wearing the devices. After the monitoring period, each subject's insulin pump, CGM, and accelerometer/HRM were downloaded and the data were used to augment an existing PLGS algorithm to incorporate activity. Using a computer simulator, the accelerometer-augmented algorithm was compared to the HRM-augmented algorithm to determine which was most effective at mitigating hypoglycemia. Mean length of monitoring was 4.9 days. Across all subjects, 11 061 CGM readings were recorded during the monitoring period. In the simulator analysis, the PLGS algorithm reduced hypoglycemia by 62%, compared to 71% and 74% reductions for the HRM-augmented and accelerometer-augmented algorithms, respectively; combined accelerometer and HRM augmentation provided a 76% reduction. In a simulated setting, the accelerometer-augmented pump suspension algorithm decreases the incidence of exercise-related hypoglycemia by a meaningful amount compared to the PLGS algorithm alone. Results also failed to justify the additional user burden of a HRM.

Autonomy of patients with type 2 diabetes with an insulin pump device: is it predictable?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876438/),"
Insulin pump therapy may be offered to patients with type 2 diabetes that is not controlled by multiple daily injections. Patients with type 2 diabetes may suffer from unrecognized cognitive disabilities, which may compromise the use of a pump device.
To predict patient autonomy, we evaluated 39 patients with type 2 diabetes from our database (n = 143) after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) initiation using (1) an autonomy questionnaire evaluating the patient's cognitive and operative capacities for CSII utilization, (2) the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) for the detection of mild cognitive disabilities, (3) the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for the detection of anxiety and depression, and (4) the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ). Patients were selected to constitute 3 groups matched for age, with different degrees of autonomy at discharge after the initial training program: complete (n = 13), partial (n = 13), or no autonomy (n = 13).
The satisfaction level with the pump device was high. At the last follow-up visit, only 23% of patients did not reach complete autonomy. The autonomy score correlated fairly with the MOCA score (R = 0.771, P < .001). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed that at a cut-off score of 24, the MOCA identified autonomous versus dependent patients at long-term follow-up (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.893; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 81%). The HADS correlated negatively with the autonomy score, and the sociocultural level also influenced autonomy with pump utilization.
Patients with type 2 diabetes with partial autonomy at discharge may progress to complete autonomy. The MOCA and HADS may help predict a patient's ability to manage with a pump device.

Characterizing normal-use temperature conditions of pumped insulin.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24876429/),"
In this study, the temperature profiles of insulin pump reservoirs during normal wear conditions across multiple seasons were characterized. Thermocouples secured in reservoirs filled with insulin diluent were loaded in infusion pumps worn by volunteers. Reservoir and ambient environmental temperature data and activity levels were logged during the course of normal daily activities in February (winter), April (spring), and August (summer). Each seasonal data set comprised 7 to 14 days of wear from 3 to 5 volunteers. Reservoir temperature profiles were generally higher than ambient temperatures, likely due to heat transfer from the wearer when the pump was placed close to the body. Temperature conditions inside pump reservoirs fluctuated between 25°C and 37°C regardless of seasonal variations. The average reservoir temperature remained close to 30°C across all seasons, notably lower than used in previously published compatibility and stability protocols (37°C). Results from this study could be utilized to develop more accurate stability and compatibility testing procedures for new insulin formulations and/or delivery devices.

Recovery of hypoglycemia awareness in long-standing type 1 diabetes: a multicenter 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial comparing insulin pump with multiple daily injections and continuous with conventional glucose self-monitoring (HypoCOMPaSS).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24854041/),"
To determine whether impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) can be improved and severe hypoglycemia (SH) prevented in type 1 diabetes, we compared an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) with multiple daily injections (MDIs) and adjuvant real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT) with conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG).
A 24-week 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial in adults with type 1 diabetes and IAH was conducted. All received comparable education, support, and congruent therapeutic targets aimed at rigorous avoidance of biochemical hypoglycemia without relaxing overall control. Primary end point was between-intervention difference in 24-week hypoglycemia awareness (Gold score).
A total of 96 participants (mean diabetes duration 29 years) were randomized. Overall, biochemical hypoglycemia (≤3.0 mmol/L) decreased (53 ± 63 to 24 ± 56 min/24 h; P = 0.004 [t test]) without deterioration in HbA1c. Hypoglycemia awareness improved (5.1 ± 1.1 to 4.1 ± 1.6; P = 0.0001 [t test]) with decreased SH (8.9 ± 13.4 to 0.8 ± 1.8 episodes/patient-year; P = 0.0001 [t test]). At 24 weeks, there was no significant difference in awareness comparing CSII with MDI (4.1 ± 1.6 vs. 4.2 ± 1.7; difference 0.1; 95% CI -0.6 to 0.8) and RT with SMBG (4.3 ± 1.6 vs. 4.0 ± 1.7; difference -0.3; 95% CI -1.0 to 0.4). Between-group analyses demonstrated comparable reductions in SH, fear of hypoglycemia, and insulin doses with equivalent HbA1c. Treatment satisfaction was higher with CSII than MDI (32 ± 3 vs. 29 ± 6; P = 0.0003 [t test]), but comparable with SMBG and RT (30 ± 5 vs. 30 ± 5; P = 0.79 [t test]).
Hypoglycemia awareness can be improved and recurrent SH prevented in long-standing type 1 diabetes without relaxing HbA1c. Similar biomedical outcomes can be attained with conventional MDI and SMBG regimens compared with CSII/RT, although satisfaction was higher with CSII.

"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in preschool children: butt or tummy, which is the best infusion set site?",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24801644/),"
Choosing the right infusion set site can be an important factor in obtaining good glycemic control, especially in very young children. In an attempt to identify the best infusion site, we performed a crossover study in six preschool children with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy.
We enrolled six patients 5.2±0.7 years old (range, 4-6 years), with type 1 diabetes for more than 1.5 years, using insulin pump therapy for at least 6 months. For each patient, body mass index, glycated hemoglobin, and all data downloaded from the system were evaluated on two occasions: the first with the infusion set placed on the buttock and the second on the abdomen, each for 3 days. The order of infusion set placement was randomized. Mean capillary blood glucose, mean continuous glycemia, mean area under the curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule for both >140 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL, insulin daily dose, carbohydrate/insulin ratio, total basal insulin, total bolus insulin, and mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE) were evaluated.
Mean glycemic values, mean AUC >140 mg/dL, and MAGE were significantly lower when the infusion set was placed on the buttock versus the abdomen (144.6±31.9 mg/dL vs. 166.0±34.8 mg/dL [P=0.000], 28.4±18.3% vs. 48.8±28.2% [P=0.000], and 32±10 vs. 60±15 mg/dL [P<0.001], respectively), whereas mean AUC <70 mg/dL was higher (1.47±2.77% vs. 0.87±1.03% [P<0.001]).
The present findings suggest that preschool children with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy could benefit from inserting the infusion set in the buttock instead of the abdomen.

Factors associated with glycemic control in adult type 1 diabetes patients treated with insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24798448/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by insulin pump seems to improve glycemia and quality of life as compared to conventional insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). However, while many T1DM subjects achieve excellent glycemic control, some others cannot reach recommended goals. In a retrospective analysis, we searched for factors associated with glycemic control in T1DM patients treated with insulin pump therapy. Data from 192 patients (133 women and 59 men) treated with personal insulin pumps at the Department of Metabolic Diseases, University Hospital, Krakow, Poland were analyzed. Sources of information included medical records, memory read-outs from insulin pumps and data from glucose meters. Univariate, multivariate linear and logistic regression analysis for the association with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level were performed. The mean age of the subjects was 28.9 (±11.2) years, the mean duration of T1DM-14.6 (±7.6) years, mean body mass index-23.5 (±3.1) kg/m2. The mean HbA1c level in the entire study group was 7.4% (57 mmol/mol). In the multivariate linear regression analysis, HbA1c correlated with the mean number of daily blood glucose measurements, number of hypoglycemic episodes per 100 blood glucose measurements, age at the examination, and continuous glucose monitoring system use. Multivariate logistic regression analysis for reaching the therapeutic target of HbA1c<7.0% (53 mmol/mol) showed that the independent predictors of achieving this goal included the same four variables. In a large clinical observation, we identified that patient-related and technological factors associated with glycemic control in adult pump-treated T1DM subjects.

Insulin pump-associated adverse events in children and adolescents--a prospective study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24796368/),"
Intensive insulin regimens are now the mainstay of modern, type 1 diabetes mellitus management. Insulin pumps (CSII) are a key technique used. Although there has been considerable study of outcomes, there are few recent data on CSII-associated adverse events (AEs) and their incidence and characteristics.
Phone calls to our 24-h diabetes support service were screened for CSII-associated AEs. Phone interviews were conducted with the parent/patient, within 96â€‰h of the event. Interviews explored AE characteristics and the role of the user, as well as questions relating to outcome and the impact to the family and patient. Comparisons were made with clinic CSII patients not reporting an AE.
Over a 16-week study period, 50 confirmed AEs occurred in 45 of 405 (11.1%) patients. This was annualized to an AE incidence of 40 AEs/100 person-years. Pump malfunction and infusion set/site failures were the most common events reported, occurring in 27 (54.0%) and 18 (36.0%) AEs, respectively. A user- or education-related issue was implicated in 22 (44.0%) events. Pump replacement occurred in 19 of 50 occurrences (38.0%). Additionally, 16 (32.0%) reported a hospital admission or emergency department attendance as a consequence. When compared with those on CSII not reporting an AE, AEs were associated with age <10 years (odds ratio=3.2 [95% confidence interval, 1.7-6.1]) but not with gender, glycosylated hemoglobin, diabetes duration, or pumping duration.
This is the first prospective study to look at AEs in modern-generation insulin pumps. AEs appear common and should be anticipated. Their origin is multifactorial, with the pump, associated consumables, and the user all being important factors. Ongoing support and anticipatory education are essential to minimize pump-associated AEs and their impact.

Insulin pump therapy in youth with type 1 diabetes: toward closed-loop systems.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24749563/),"
Insulin pump technology has advanced considerably over the past three decades, leading to more favorable metabolic control and less hypoglycemic events when compared with multiple daily injection therapy. The use of insulin pumps is increasing, particularly in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
This review outlines recent developments in insulin pump therapy from a pediatric perspective. 'Smart' pumps, sensor-augmented pump therapy and threshold-suspend feature of insulin pumps are reviewed in terms of efficacy, safety and psychosocial impact. The current status of closed-loop systems focusing on clinical outcomes is highlighted.
Closed-loop insulin delivery is gradually progressing from bench to the clinical practice. Longer and larger studies in home settings are needed to expand on short- to medium-term outpatient evaluations. Predictive low glucose management and overnight closed-loop delivery may be the next applications to be implemented in daily routine. Further challenges include improvements of control algorithms, sensor accuracy, duration of insulin action, integration and size of devices and connectivity and usability. Gradual improvements and increasing sophistication of closed-loop components lie on the path toward unsupervised hands-off fully closed-loop system.

Risk factors for discontinuation of insulin pump therapy in pediatric and young adult patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24735947/),"
Previous studies have shown that only a small number of pediatric and young adult patients discontinue pump therapy, but risk factors for discontinuation are unclear.
To identify characteristics of pediatric and young adult patients with pump therapy which are associated with discontinuation of treatment.
Retrospective cohort study using a representative nationwide database (LRx; IMS Health) in Germany covering >80% of all prescriptions to members of statutory health insurances in 2008-2011. All patients (age group <25 years) with new prescriptions of insulin pumps were identified (2009-2010) and were followed for 12 months.
Overall, 2452 new pump users were identified, of whom 177 (7.2%) switched to other forms of insulin therapy within 12 months. In multivariate logistic regression, younger age (<6 years; reference 18 to <25 years: Odds ratio, OR, 95% CI: 0.36; 0.17-0.74) and use of teflon needles (reference steel needles: OR, 95% CI: 0.59; 0.41-0.83) were related to a lower odds of pump discontinuation. A non-significant trend was found for male sex (OR, 95% CI: 0.75; 0.52-1.08). Prescriptions of thyroid therapeutics (ATC H03A: OR, 95% CI: 1.79; 1.23-2.61) and antiepileptics (N03: OR, 95% CI: 3.14; 1.49-6.59) were significantly associated with discontinuation of pump therapy.
About 93% of pediatric and young adult patients maintained insulin pump therapy within 12 months. Age <6 years, male sex and teflon needle use were associated with a lower risk of discontinuation. Thyroid therapy (indicating autoimmunity) and antiepileptic drug prescriptions were associated with a higher likelihood for discontinuation of insulin pump treatment.

Assessment of use of specific features of subcutaneous insulin infusion systems and their relationship to metabolic control in patients with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24533929/),"
Patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) have available several specific features of these devices. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between real use of them and the degree of glycemic control in patients using this therapy.
Forty-four T1DM patients on CSII therapy with or without real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were included. Data from 14 consecutive days were retrospectively collected using the therapy management software CareLink Personal/Pro(®) and HbA1c measurement performed at that period. The relationship between the frequency of usie of specific features of insulin pumps (non-sensor augmented or sensor-augmented) and glycemic control was analyzed.
Mean HbA1c in the group was 7.5 ± .8%. Mean daily number of boluses administered was 5.1 ± 1.8, with 75.4% of them being bolus wizards (BW). Daily number of boluses was significantly greater in patients with HbA1c <7.5% than in those with HbA1c>7.5% (5.3 ± 1.6 vs. 4.3 ± 1.6, P=.056). There was a trend to greater use of BW in patients with better control (82.8 ± 21.4% vs. 69.9 ± 29.1%, P=.106). HbA1c was lower in patients using CGM (n=8) as compared to those not using sensor-augmented pumps (7.6 ± .8 vs 7.1 ± .7, P=.067), but the difference was not statistically significant.
More frequent use of BW appears to be associated to better metabolic control in patients with T1DM using pump therapy. In standard clinical practice, augmentation of insulin pump with CGM may be associated to improved glycemic control.

Insulin pump use in young children in the T1D Exchange clinic registry is associated with lower hemoglobin A1c levels than injection therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24494980/),"
Insulin delivery via injection and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via insulin pump were compared in a cross-sectional study (n = 669) and retrospective longitudinal study (n = 1904) of young children (<6 yr) with type 1 diabetes (T1D) participating in the T1D Exchange clinic registry. Use of CSII correlated with longer T1D duration (p < 0.001), higher parental education (p < 0.001), and annual household income (p < 0.006) but not with race/ethnicity. Wide variation in pump use was observed among T1D Exchange centers even after adjusting for these factors, suggesting that prescriber preference is a substantial determinant of CSII use. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was lower in pump vs. injection users (7.9 vs. 8.5%, adjusted p < 0.001) in the cross-sectional study. In the longitudinal study, HbA1c decreased after initiation of CSII by 0.2%, on average (p < 0.001). Frequency of a severe hypoglycemia (SH) event did not differ in pump vs. injection users (p = 0.2). Frequency of ≥1 parent-reported diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) event in the prior year was greater in pump users than injection users (10 vs. 8%, p = 0.04). No differences between pump and injection users were observed for clinic-reported DKA events. Children below 6 yr have many unique metabolic characteristics, feeding behaviors, and care needs compared with older children and adolescents. These data support the use of insulin pumps in this youngest age group, and suggest that metabolic control may be improved without increasing the frequency of SH, but care should be taken as to the possibly increased risk of DKA.

The PILGRIM study: in silico modeling of a predictive low glucose management system and feasibility in youth with type 1 diabetes during exercise.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24447074/),"
Predictive low glucose management (PLGM) may help prevent hypoglycemia by stopping insulin pump delivery based on predicted sensor glucose values.
Hypoglycemic challenges were simulated using the Food and Drug Administration-accepted glucose simulator with 100 virtual patients. PLGM was then tested with a system composed of a Paradigm(®) insulin pump (Medtronic, Northridge, CA), an Enlite™ glucose sensor (Medtronic), and a BlackBerry(®) (Waterloo, ON, Canada)-based controller. Subjects (n=22) on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (five females, 17 males; median [range] age, 15 [range, 14-20] years; median [range] diabetes duration, 7 [2-14] years; median [range] glycated hemoglobin, 8.0% [6.7-10.4%]) exercised until the PLGM system suspended insulin delivery or until the reference blood glucose value (HemoCue(®); HemoCue GmbH, Großostheim, Germany) reached the predictive suspension threshold setting.
PLGM reduced hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dL) in silico by 26.7% compared with no insulin suspension, as opposed to a 5.3% reduction in hypoglycemia with use of low glucose suspend (LGS). The median duration of hypoglycemia (time spent <70 mg/dL) with PLGM was significantly less than with LGS (58 min vs. 101 min, respectively; P<0.001). In the clinical trial the hypoglycemic threshold during exercise was reached in 73% of the patients, and hypoglycemia was prevented in 80% of the successful experiments. The mean (±SD) sensor glucose at predictive suspension was 92±7 mg/dL, resulting in a postsuspension nadir (by HemoCue) of 77±22 mg/dL. The suspension lasted for 90±35 (range, 30-120) min, resulting in a sensor glucose level at insulin resumption of 97±19 mg/dL.
In silico modeling and early feasibility data demonstrate that PLGM may further reduce the severity of hypoglycemia beyond that already established for algorithms that use a threshold-based suspension.

Insulin pump use in pregnancy is associated with lower HbA1c without increasing the rate of severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in women with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24434960/),"
The aim of this study was to compare glycaemic control and maternal-fetal outcomes in women with type 1 diabetes managed on insulin pumps compared with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI).
In a retrospective study, glycaemic control and outcomes of 387 consecutive pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes who attended specialised clinics at three centres 2006-2010 were assessed.
Women using insulin pumps (129/387) were older and had a longer duration of diabetes, more retinopathy, smoked less in pregnancy, and had more preconception care (p < 0.01 for each). Among 113 pregnancies >20 weeks' gestation in women on insulin pumps and 218 in women on MDI, there was a significant difference in HbA1c in the first trimester (mean HbA1c 6.90 ± 0.71% (52 ± 7.8 mmol/mol) vs 7.60 ± 1.38% (60 ± 15.1 mmol/mol), p < 0.001), which persisted until the third trimester (mean HbA1c 6.49 ± 0.52% (47 ± 5.7 mmol/mol) vs 6.81 ± 0.85% (51 ± 9.3 mmol/mol), p = 0.002). Rates of diabetic ketoacidosis were similar in women on insulin pumps vs MDI (1.8% vs 3.0%, p = 0.72). Despite lower HbA1c, women on insulin pumps did not have an increased incidence of severe hypoglycaemia (8.0% vs 7.6%, p = 0.90) or more weight gain (16.3 ± 8.7 vs 15.2 ± 6.2 kg, p = 0.18). More large-for-gestational-age infants in the pump group (55.0% vs 39.2%, p = 0.007) may have resulted from confounding by parity.
In this large multicentre study, women using insulin pumps in pregnancy had lower HbA1c without increased risk of severe hypoglycaemia or diabetic ketoacidosis but no improvement in other pregnancy outcomes. This information can help inform care providers and patients about the glycaemic effectiveness and safety of insulin pumps in pregnancy.

Insulin pump therapy in transient neonatal diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24904869/),"
Neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM) is a rare disease requiring insulin treatment. Its treatment is primarily focused on maintaining adequate glycemic control and avoiding hypoglycemia. Although insulin pump therapy is frequently administered to adults and children, there is no consensus on the use of insulin pumps in NDM. A 10 day-old female infant was referred to us with intrauterine growth retardation and poor weight gain. Hyperglycemia was noted, and continuous intravenous insulin infusion was initiated. However, the patient's serum glucose levels fluctuated widely, and maintaining the intravenous route became difficult within the following weeks. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an insulin pump was introduced on the twenty-fifth day of life, and good glycemic control was achieved without any notable adverse effects including hypoglycemia. We suggest that the insulin pump is a safe and effective mode for treating NDM and its early adoption may shorten the length of hospital stays in patients with NDM.

A multicentre randomized controlled trial of an empowerment-inspired intervention for adolescents starting continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion--a study protocol.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24354899/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment among children with type 1 diabetes is increasing in Sweden. However, studies evaluating glycaemic control in children using CSII show inconsistent results. The distribution of responsibility for diabetes self-management between children and parents is often unclear and needs clarification. There is much published support for continued parental involvement and shared diabetes management during adolescence. Guided Self-Determination (GSD) is an empowerment-based, person-centred, reflection and problem solving method intended to guide the patient to become self-sufficient and develop life skills for managing difficulties in diabetes self-management. This method has been adapted for adolescents and parents as Guided Self-Determination-Young (GSD-Y). This study aims to evaluate the effect of an intervention with GSD-Y in groups of adolescents starting on insulin pumps and their parents on diabetes-related family conflicts, perceived health and quality of life (QoL), and metabolic control. Here, we describe the protocol and plans for study enrollment.
This study is designed as a randomized, controlled, prospective, multicentre study. Eighty patients between 12-18 years of age who are planning to start CSII will be included. All adolescents and their parents will receive standard insulin pump training. The education intervention will be conducted when CSII is to be started and at four appointments in the first 4 months after starting CSII. The primary outcome is haemoglobin A1c levels. Secondary outcomes are perceived health and QoL, frequency of blood glucose self-monitoring and bolus doses, and usage of carbohydrate counting. The following instruments will be used: Disabkids, 'Check your health', the Diabetes Family Conflict Scale and the Swedish Diabetes Empowerment Scale. Outcomes will be evaluated within and between groups by comparing data at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months after starting treatment.
In this study, we will assess the effect of starting an CSII together with the model of GSD to determine whether this approach leads to retention of improved glycaemic control, QoL, responsibility distribution and reduced diabetes-related conflicts in the family.

The evidence base for diabetes technology: appropriate and inappropriate meta-analysis.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24351183/),"
When we are interested in making decisions about best use, comparative therapeutic efficacy, or cost-effectiveness of diabetes technologies such as insulin pump therapy [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] or continuous glucose monitoring, meta-analysis for the purpose of literature summary is inappropriate and may be misleading. Instead, ""decision-making meta-analysis"" is more appropriate and should involve either preselection of trials based on intended use [e.g., elevated baseline hemoglobin A1c or hypoglycemia rate for trials of multiple daily injections (MDI) versus CSII] or metaregression of summary effect sizes in different trials against potential effect-modifying covariates such as baseline risk, or models of the covariates that determine effect size using individual patient data. Appropriate meta-analysis should also only include trials that are of sufficient duration to accurately measure outcomes such as severe hypoglycemia, and they should not use obsolete technology that is of proven inferiority to current technology. The use of appropriate decision-making meta-analysis is illustrated by the change in the rate ratio for severe hypoglycemia in randomized controlled trials of MDI versus CSII in type 1 diabetes from 1.56 (95% confidence interval 0.96-2.55; p = .074) for literature-summary meta-analysis to 2.0 (1.08-3.69; p = .027) for decision-making meta-analysis of all patients and 3.91 (1.35-11.36; p = .01) for trials in children.

Quantitative estimation of insulin sensitivity in type 1 diabetic subjects wearing a sensor-augmented insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24319120/),"
The goal was to develop a new index of insulin sensitivity in patients with type 1 diabetes estimated from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and subcutaneous insulin delivery data under carefully controlled conditions.
The database consists of 12 subjects with type 1 diabetes, studied during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, in a clinical research unit, wearing both subcutaneous insulin pump and CGM device. Frequent blood samples were drawn for measurements of plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in order to estimate insulin sensitivity with the oral minimal model (SI(MM)). The new index of insulin sensitivity (SI(SP)) was calculated with a simple algebraic formula for each meal, using only CGM and insulin pump data and compared with SI(MM).
SI(SP) was well correlated with SI(MM) (r = 0.825; P < 10(-8)), and diurnal pattern was also similar to SI(MM).
A novel method for estimating insulin sensitivity in subjects with type 1 diabetes on sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy has been presented. This new index correlates well with the reference oral minimal model estimate of insulin sensitivity. The knowledge of patient-specific insulin sensitivity and its diurnal variation can help in optimizing insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes and could also inform next-generation closed-loop control systems.

Family perceptions of insulin pump adverse events in children and adolescents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24313790/),"
Insulin pumps (for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) are used widely in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Although there has been considerable study of outcomes, there are few recent data on CSII-associated adverse events and no data on family perceptions of adverse events and their confidence in dealing with them.
We approached all families of children and adolescents ≤ 19 years of age on CSII attending the diabetes clinic over a 16-week clinic cycle. Participants completed a retrospective questionnaire examining issues over the previous 12 months. Data on pump adverse events as well as answers to questions pertaining to education and confidence were collected.
Our survey received a response rate of 99%, with 235 of the 238 families approached participating. In the preceding 12 months, 104 of 230 (45%) had reported at least one pump-related adverse event (either mechanical or set-related), with an associated 52 of 229 (23%) resulting in pump replacement. This equated to a minimum incidence density of 53 adverse events/100 person-years. Additionally, 18 of 230 (8%) reported a hospital admission or emergency department attendance as a consequence. Pump malfunction and infusion set/site failures were the most common events reported, with one or more events in 58 of 104 (56%) and 47 of 104 (45%), respectively. Adverse events, excluding set/site failures, were associated with older age (13.1 ± 3.4 years vs. 11.9 ± 4 years; P = 0.02).
This is the first study to look at family perceptions of adverse events while using modern CSII. It highlights a high self-reported rate of CSII-related adverse events, pump replacement, and subsequent presentation to the hospital. Potential areas for additional targeted education are identified. Further prospective study examining pump adverse event characteristics and incidence is warranted.

Approach to the adult hospitalized patient on an insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24227761/),"
Patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, or insulin pumps, are increasingly seen in hospitals. Inpatient providers need to have a working knowledge of insulin pumps to be able to decide, in conjunction with the patient whenever feasible, whether or not pump use is to be continued in the hospital, to assist patients in adjusting insulin doses via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, to transition patients to multiple daily subcutaneous insulin dosing as appropriate, and to prevent or manage problems that might arise from improper handling of the insulin pump. Clinical vignettes with key points and strategies for patient care are discussed in this article.

Nonmetabolic complications of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a patient survey.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24180294/),"
Little is known about the frequencies and types of nonmetabolic complications occurring in type 1 diabetes patients being treated by modern insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]), when recorded by standardized questionnaire rather than clinical experience.
A self-report questionnaire was completed by successive subjects with type 1 diabetes attending an insulin pump clinic, and those with a duration of CSII of ≥6 months were selected for analysis (n=92). Questions included pump manufacturer, insulin, infusion set type and duration of use, frequency of infusion set and site problems, pump malfunctions, and patient-related problems such as weight change since starting CSII.
Median (range) duration of CSII was 3.3 (0.5-32.0) years, and mean ± SD duration of infusion set use was 3.2 ± 0.7 (range 2-6) days. The commonest infusion set problems were kinking (64.1% of subjects) and blockage (54.3%). Blockage was associated with >3 days of use of infusion sets plus lispro insulin in the pump (relative risk [95% confidence interval], 1.71 [1.03-2.85]; P=0.07). The commonest infusion site problem was lipohypertrophy (26.1%), which occurred more often in those with long duration of CSII (4.8 [2.38-9.45] vs. 3.0 [1.50-4.25] years; P=0.01). Pump malfunction had occurred in 48% of subjects (43% in the first year of CSII), with ""no delivery,"" keypad, and battery problems commonly occurring. Although some patients reported weight gain (34%) and some weight loss (15%) on CSII, most patients (51%) reported no change in weight.
Pump, infusion set, and infusion site problems remain common with CSII, even with contemporary technology.

Effectiveness of early intensive therapy on β-cell preservation in type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24130350/),"
To assess effectiveness of inpatient hybrid closed-loop control (HCLC) followed by outpatient sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy initiated within 7 days of diagnosis of type 1 diabetes on the preservation of β-cell function at 1 year.
Sixty-eight individuals (mean age 13.3 ± 5.7 years; 35% female, 92% Caucasian) were randomized to HCLC followed by SAP therapy (intensive group; N = 48) or to the usual-care group treated with multiple daily injections or insulin pump therapy (N = 20). Primary outcome was C-peptide concentrations during mixed-meal tolerance tests at 12 months.
Intensive-group participants initiated HCLC a median of 6 days after diagnosis for a median duration of 71.3 h, during which median participant mean glucose concentration was 140 mg/dL (interquartile range 134-153 mg/dL). During outpatient SAP, continuous glucose monitor (CGM) use decreased over time, and at 12 months, only 33% of intensive participants averaged sensor use ≥6 days/week. In the usual-care group, insulin pump and CGM use were initiated prior to 12 months by 15 and 5 participants, respectively. Mean HbA1c levels were similar in both groups throughout the study. At 12 months, the geometric mean (95% CI) of C-peptide area under the curve was 0.43 (0.34-0.52) pmol/mL in the intensive group and 0.52 (0.32-0.75) pmol/mL in the usual-care group (P = 0.49). Thirty-seven (79%) intensive and 16 (80%) usual-care participants had a peak C-peptide concentration ≥0.2 pmol/mL (P = 0.30).
In new-onset type 1 diabetes, HCLC followed by SAP therapy did not provide benefit in preserving β-cell function compared with current standards of care.

The U.K. service level audit of insulin pump therapy in adults.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24117515/),"
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidelines for the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in 2008 (technology appraisal 151). The first U.K.-wide insulin pump audit took place in 2012 with the aim of determining adherence to the guidance issued in NICE technology appraisal 151. The results of the adult service level audit are reported here.
All centres providing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion services to adults with diabetes in the U.K. were invited to participate. Audit metrics were aligned to technology appraisal 151. Data entry took place online using a DiabetesE formatted data collection tool.
One hundred and eighty-three centres were identified as delivering adult continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion services in the U.K., of which 178 (97.3%) participated in the audit. At the time of the audit, 13 428 adults were using insulin pump therapy, giving an estimated prevalence of use of 6%. Ninety-three per cent of centres did not report any barriers in obtaining funding for patients who fulfilled NICE criteria. The mean number of consultant programmed activities dedicated to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion services was 0.96 (range 0-8), mean whole-time equivalent diabetes specialist nurses was 0.62 (range 0-3) and mean whole-time equivalent dietitian services was 0.3 (range 0-2), of which 39, 61 and 60%, respectively, were not formally funded.
The prevalence of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion use in the U.K. falls well below the expectation of NICE (15-20%) and that of other European countries (> 15%) and the U.S.A. (40%). This may be attributable, in part, to lack of healthcare professional time needed for identification and training of new pump therapy users.

The impact of anxiety and depression on patients within a large type 1 diabetes insulin pump population. An observational study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24076359/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is generally successful for patients with type 1 diabetes in improving glycaemic control, alleviating the burden of hypoglycaemia and improving the quality of life. There is however, a cohort of patients who fail to thrive on pump therapy and psychological factors or ""brittleness"" have been posited as a cause for this. We aimed to assess the extent and spectrum of psychological illness in a population of pump patients.
We analysed the patient data and records of 350 patients with type 1 diabetes who formed the insulin pump patient population from a large teaching hospital and compared them with an age and sex matched reference population of patients with type 1 diabetes. We quantified the prevalence of anxiety and depression before and after the initiation of pump therapy and looked to see whether this had implications for changes in glycaemic control and hypoglycaemia reduction.
Mental health problems amongst patients selected for CSII occur significantly more frequently than in a matched population with type 1 diabetes (51% vs 40%, P<0.05). Depression and anxiety were more prevalent in the CSII group. Of those with mental health problems, there is a tendency to do less well in terms of improvements in glycaemic control as indicated by changes in HbA(1c) and hypoglycaemia reduction--the latter most notable in patients with co-existent depression.
The incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in individuals with diabetes is greater than that of the general population. In patients who are selected to go onto insulin pump therapy, the incidence is again greater. We have shown that in those with psychological illness, they tend to do less well in terms of improving their overall diabetes control. These results suggest that CSII may not be a suitable route of therapy alone for all of those who would fulfill the traditional criteria and suggest that psychological assessment, therapy and intervention may be an altogether more appropriate or alternative or adjunctive course of action in supporting their diabetes self management. The wider implication is that all the patients with diabetes should be regularly assessed for psychological problems and that there needs to be greater psychology/psychiatric support available to intensive diabetes clinics, especially as part of a pre-pump pathway.

Optimizing insulin pump therapy: a quality improvement project.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24045332/),"
The purpose of the study was to assess insulin pump use and provide ongoing education.
A quality improvement project using a pump assessment questionnaire was implemented at an endocrinology office in the southeastern United States. The questionnaire was designed to evaluate all aspects of insulin pump therapy, including pump operations, infusion set failure, management of acute complications, and usage of advanced device features. Eighty-nine patients (80% with type 1 diabetes and 20% with type 2 diabetes) completed the questionnaire at the endocrinology practice. A certified diabetes educator reviewed the questions with each patient, identifying deficiencies and training opportunities.
The most common areas of deficiency identified after implementation of the assessment form included the following: expired or no basal insulin prescription in the event of pump failure or removal, no mupirocin (BactrobanÂ®, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) prescription for suspected site infections, lack of insulin syringe if pump stopped working, failure to check urine ketones, no antiemetic prescription for sick day intervention, using manual bolus instead of bolus calculator, and lack of in-date glucagon kit.
Use of a pump assessment questionnaire allows for focused discussion concerning patient behaviors related to pump operations, troubleshooting, and self-management. Incorporating use of a pump assessment questionnaire into routine practice may result in improved patient education and avoidance of adverse events specific to insulin pump therapy.

Adherence in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus correlates with treatment satisfaction but not with adverse events.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24043930/),"
Diabetes self-care and self-monitoring adherence has a positive effect on the metabolic control of the disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the adherence to self-care recommendations and to identify its correlates in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
One hundred and eleven patients with type 1 diabetes were enrolled in an observational cross-sectional study conducted at the Diabetes Center of the University Hospital in Hradec Králové, Czech Republic. Diabetes self-care adherence was measured by the Self Care Inventory-Revised, and treatment satisfaction by the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire-status version. Additional data were collected from self-administered questionnaires and medical records. The Mann-Whitney test, Spearman correlations, and multiple linear regressions were used in the statistical analysis.
The mean age of patients was 42.4 years; 59.5% of them were females and 53.2% of all patients used an insulin pump. The mean glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 66.2 ± 15.3 mmol/mol and the mean insulin dosage was 0.6 ± 0.3 IU insulin/kg/day. The number of hypoglycemic episodes (including severe) that patients had in the last month before taking the survey was 3.6 ± 3.2. Self-care adherence was associated with treatment satisfaction (0.495; P = 0.004) along with frequency of self-monitoring of before meal blood glucose (0.267; P = 0.003). It was not associated with the incidence of hypoglycemic events or any other insulin therapy-related problems or with socio-demographic or clinical characteristics.
Treatment satisfaction is one of the key factors that need to be targeted to maximize benefits to patients. Self-care adherence in adults with type 1 diabetes did not correlate with socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, nor with adverse events.

Throughout pregnancy, the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio decreased at all three main meals. The most pronounced decrease was observed at breakfast, where the carbohydrate-to-insulin ratio was reduced, from median 12 (range 4-20) in early pregnancy to 3 (2-10) g carbohydrate per unit insulin in late pregnancy. Basal insulin delivery increased by ∼50%, i.e. from 0.8 (0.5-2.2) to 1.2 (0.6-2.5) IU/h at 5 a.m. and from 1.0 (0.6-1.5) to 1.3 (0.2-2.3) IU/h at 5 p.m. during pregnancy. HbA1c levels during pregnancy, the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia and pregnancy outcomes were similar in the two groups.

To estimate diabetes-related direct health care costs in pediatric patients with early-onset type 1 diabetes of long duration in Germany.
Data of a population-based cohort of 1,473 subjects with type 1 diabetes onset at 0-4 years of age within the years 1993-1999 were included (mean age 13.9 (SD 2.2) years, mean diabetes duration 10.9 (SD 1.9) years, as of 31.12.2007). Diabetes-related health care services utilized in 2007 were derived from a nationwide prospective documentation system (DPV). Health care utilization was valued in monetary terms based on inpatient and outpatient medical fees and retail prices (perspective of statutory health insurance). Multiple regression models were applied to assess associations between direct diabetes-related health care costs per patient-year and demographic and clinical predictors.
Mean direct diabetes-related health care costs per patient-year were €3,745 (inter-quartile range: 1,943-4,881). Costs for glucose self-monitoring were the main cost category (28.5%), followed by costs for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (25.0%), diabetes-related hospitalizations (22.1%) and insulin (18.4%). Female gender, pubertal age and poor glycemic control were associated with higher and migration background with lower total costs.
Main cost categories in patients with on average 11 years of diabetes duration were costs for glucose self-monitoring, insulin pump therapy, hospitalization and insulin. Optimization of glycemic control in particular in pubertal age through intensified care with improved diabetes education and tailored insulin regimen, can contribute to the reduction of direct diabetes-related costs in this patient group.

Long-term outcome of insulin pump therapy in children with type 1 diabetes assessed in a large population-based case-control study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23963323/),"
We determined the impact of insulin pump therapy on long-term glycaemic control, BMI, rate of severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children.
Patients on pump therapy at a single paediatric tertiary hospital were matched to patients treated by injections on the basis of age, duration of diabetes and HbA1c at the time of pump start. HbA1c, anthropometric data, episodes of severe hypoglycaemia and rates of hospitalisation for DKA were collected prospectively.
A total of 345 patients on pump therapy were matched to controls on injections. The mean age, duration of diabetes at pump start and length of follow-up were 11.4 (± 3.5), 4.1 (± 3.0) and 3.5 (± 2.5) years, respectively. The mean HbA1c reduction in the pump cohort was 0.6% (6.6 mmol/mol). This improved HbA1c remained significant throughout the 7 years of follow-up. Pump therapy reduced severe hypoglycaemia from 14.7 to 7.2 events per 100 patient-years (p < 0.001). In contrast, severe hypoglycaemia increased in the non-pump cohort over the same period from 6.8 to 10.2 events per 100 patient-years. The rate of hospitalisation for DKA was lower in the pump cohort (2.3 vs 4.7 per 100 patient-years, p = 0.003) over the 1,160 patient-years of follow-up.
This is the longest and largest study of insulin pump use in children and demonstrates that pump therapy provides a sustained improvement in glycaemic control, and reductions of severe hypoglycaemia and hospitalisation for DKA compared with a matched cohort using injections.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) patients experience switches of pump systems on a regular basis. We investigated the impact of transition from older pumps to the Accu-Chek(®) Combo system (Roche Diagnostics Deutschland GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) on a patient's glycemic control and diabetes management.
In total, 299 patients (172 female, 127 male; mean±SD age, 39.4±15.2 years; CSII duration, 7.0±5.2 years) were enrolled by 61 European sites into this uncontrolled prospective trial. Glycemic control, safety, and diabetes management parameters were measured at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. Changes from baseline were analyzed.
After transition to the new insulin pump, mean±SD hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values decreased from 7.8±1.1% (baseline) to 7.7±1.1% (end point). The proportion of patients with HbA1c <7.0% was slightly higher at the end of the study (29.6%) than at baseline (25.2%), whereas the proportion of patients with HbA1c >8.0% decreased (baseline, 36.2%; end point, 32.7%; P<0.05). The number of hypoglycemic episodes (blood glucose<70 mg/dL) improved slightly during the study (baseline, 40.4±34.0 events/quarter; end point, 39.2±33.9 events/quarter). Glycemic control improved significantly in the group with an initial HbA1c >8.0% (-0.46%; P<0.001) and remained solidly stable in the group with an initial HbA1c <7% (+0.04%; not significant). Short-term (<3 years) pump users (n=48) had a larger HbA1c decrease (-0.40%) than long-term (≥3 years) users (n=251) (-0.07%; P<0.05). The number of blood glucose measurements increased (3.7±1.9/day vs. 4.4±1.8/day; P<0.05), whereas the number of insulin boluses decreased (5.1±1.9/day vs. 4.6±1.5/day; P<0.05) during the study.
Transition from older pump systems to the Accu-Chek Combo system in a large patient population resulted in stable glycemic control with significant improvements in HbA1c in patients with unsatisfactory baseline HbA1c and shorter pump use. Increased frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose and decrease of bolus frequency could suggest a more confident diabetes management and a reduced need for correction boluses.

Comparative dose accuracy of durable and patch insulin infusion pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911184/),"
As all major insulin pump manufacturers comply with the international infusion pump standard EN 60601-2-24:1998, there may be a general assumption that all pumps are equal in insulin-delivery accuracy. This research investigates single-dose and averaged-dose accuracy of incremental basal deliveries for one patch model and three durable models of insulin pumps.
For each pump model, discrete single doses delivered during 0.5 U/h basal rate infusion over a 20 h period were measured using a time-stamped microgravimetric system. Dose accuracy was analyzed by comparing single doses and time-averaged doses to specific accuracy thresholds (±5% to ±30%).
The percentage of single doses delivered outside accuracy thresholds of ±5%, ±10%, and ±20% were as follows: Animas OneTouch® Ping® (43.2%, 14.3%, and 1.8%, respectively), Roche Accu-Chek® Combo (50.6%, 24.4%, and 5.5%), Medtronic Paradigm® Revel™/Veo™ (54.2%, 26.7%, and 6.6%), and Insulet OmniPod® (79.1%, 60.5%, and 34.9%). For 30 min, 1 h, and 2 h averaging windows, the percentage of doses delivered outside a ±15% accuracy were as follows: OneTouch Ping (1.0%, 0.4%, and 0%, respectively), Accu-Chek Combo (4.2%, 3.5%, and 3.1%), Paradigm Revel/Veo (3.9%, 3.1%, and 2.2%), and OmniPod (33.9%, 19.9%, and 10.3%).
This technical evaluation demonstrates significant differences in single-dose and averaged-dose accuracy among the insulin pumps tested. Differences in dose accuracy were most evident between the patch pump model and the group of durable pump models. Of the pumps studied, the Animas OneTouch Ping demonstrated the best single-dose and averaged-dose accuracy. Further research on the clinical relevance of these findings is warranted.

"ASPIRE In-Home: rationale, design, and methods of a study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of automatic insulin suspension for nocturnal hypoglycemia.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911183/),"
Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a barrier to therapy intensification efforts in diabetes. The Paradigm® Veo™ system may mitigate nocturnal hypoglycemia by automatically suspending insulin when a prespecified sensor glucose threshold is reached. ASPIRE (Automation to Simulate Pancreatic Insulin REsponse) In-Home (NCT01497938) was a multicenter, randomized, parallel, adaptive study of subjects with type 1 diabetes. The control arm used sensor-augmented pump therapy. The treatment arm used sensor-augmented pump therapy with threshold suspend, which automatically suspends the insulin pump in response to a sensor glucose value at or below a prespecified threshold. To be randomized, subjects had to have demonstrated ≥2 episodes of nocturnal hypoglycemia, defined as &gt;20 consecutive minutes of sensor glucose values ≤65 mg/dl starting between 10:00 PM and 8:00 AM in the 2-week run-in phase. The 3-month study phase evaluated safety by comparing changes in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values and evaluated efficacy by comparing the mean area under the glucose concentration time curves for nocturnal hypoglycemia events in the two groups. Other outcomes included the rate of nocturnal hypoglycemia events and the distribution of sensor glucose values. Data from the ASPIRE In-Home study should provide evidence on the safety of the threshold suspend feature with respect to A1C and its efficacy with respect to severity and duration of nocturnal hypoglycemia when used at home over a 3-month period.

Importance of manually entering blood glucose readings when wireless-compatible meters are not being used with an insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23911171/),"
The objective was to determine if there were differences in blood glucose monitoring (BGM) data downloaded from insulin pumps of patients who use meters that wirelessly transmit data to their insulin pumps (i.e., wireless group) and those who do not (i.e., nonwireless group).
Blood glucose monitoring data were downloaded from the meters and insulin pumps of 47 children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Independent and paired t tests compared BGM data downloaded from meters and BGM data downloaded from insulin pumps.
There were significant differences in BGM data downloaded from the insulin pumps of patients using wireless meters compared to those using nonwireless meters. Wireless patients appeared to engage in more BGM, had more low and in-range BG readings and fewer very high BG readingss than nonwireless patients. However, a comparison of BGM data downloaded from meters and insulin pumps of nonwireless patients indicated that their insulin pump data significantly underestimated the number of BGM readings conducted, as well as the number of low and in-range readings, while overestimating the number of very high BGM readings.
Because patients who use nonwireless-compatible meters do not manually enter their low and in-range BGM readings into the insulin pump, BGM data downloaded only from pumps may provide an incomplete representation of BGM frequency or results. It is recommended that patients use meters that directly communicate with pumps or perform bolus calculations. Patients should be educated about the importance of manually entering all BGM readings if they do not use a wireless-compatible meter with their insulin pump.

"Race, socioeconomic status, and treatment center are associated with insulin pump therapy in youth in the first year following diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23869706/),"
Increasing numbers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have been placed on insulin pump therapy. Nevertheless, data are limited regarding patterns of pump use during the first year of treatment and the clinical and socioeconomic factors associated with early use of pump therapy. Therefore, we sought to determine factors associated with pump therapy within the first year of diagnosis in youth enrolled in the Pediatric Diabetes Consortium (PDC) T1D New-Onset (NeOn) Study.
The NeOn Study includes youth <19 years old at T1D diagnosis who have been followed from the time of diagnosis at seven U.S. pediatric diabetes centers. Cox regression was used to determine factors associated with transition from injection to pump therapy during the first year of T1D in 1,012 participants.
Twenty-seven percent (n=254) of participants began pump therapy within the first year of diagnosis, ranging from 18% to 59% among the seven centers. After adjusting for center effect, factors associated with pump use in multivariate analysis included private health insurance (37% vs. 7%; P<0.001), having annual household income over $100,000 (50% vs. 15%; P<0.001), and non-Hispanic white race (36% vs. 11%; P<0.001). The hemoglobin A1c level did not appear to influence the decision to initiate pump use.
Participants of non-Hispanic white race and higher socioeconomic status were more likely to be placed on pumps during the first year. Further investigations are needed to gain a better understanding of barriers to use of pumps in youth with T1D, especially in disadvantaged and minority families.

Human factors research applied: the development of a personal touch screen insulin pump and users' perceptions of actual use.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23819780/),"
A brief history of the field of human factors research is covered, along with how this discipline is leveraged within medical device companies, to eliminate design flaws in products, in order to make them safe and effective for human use. The way in which human factors research was used to develop the t:slim(®) insulin delivery system (Tandem Diabetes Care(®) Inc., San Diego, CA) is also discussed. Following the development of the t:slim pump, a product evaluation study was conducted to assess users' perceptions of the t:slim pump under actual use conditions versus their current pump system.
A 30-day, within-subjects study with a total of 74 participants was conducted at four different investigator sites across the United States. Study participants used the t:slim insulin pump in their normal environment for 30 days. Participants were given the Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire during their first visit to assess their current insulin pump and then at the end of the study to measure their perceptions of the t:slim pump. A paired-samples t test was completed to analyze the data.
The results indicated that 16 of the questionnaire variables showed statistically significant differences in scores.
It was found that the utilization of a systematic human factors process resulted in an insulin pump that was proved to be safe and effective for human use and was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. In addition, the results of the product evaluation study showed that, after use of the t:slim pump for 30 days, participants' perceptions of several variables improved.

Parental mastery of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion skills and glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23799273/),"
The purpose of this study is to determine whether parental knowledge of the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) device affects glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c (A1C) level.
Parents of children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using CSII completed a 14-item questionnaire. Questions 1-10 were knowledge-based questions that required the parent to extract specific information from their child's CSII device. Questions 11-14 asked parents to provide a self-assessment of their CSII knowledge.
Twenty-two parents of youth with T1DM participated in the study. Ten of the youth were in the Low-A1C group (A1C<8%), and the other 12 were in the High-A1C group (A1Câ‰¥8%). Parents of youth in the Low-A1C group scored statistically better on the 10-item performance survey than parents of youth in the High-A1C group. Most of the parents of children in the Low-A1C group responded that they knew their child's insulin pump ""very well"" and that their pump knowledge had ""increased"" since their child started on the insulin pump.
Our findings reveal that youth with T1DM whose parents are more knowledgeable about pump functions have optimal glycemic control as evidenced by A1C. These findings underscore the importance of ongoing pump training for both pediatric patients and their parents.

Threshold-based insulin-pump interruption for reduction of hypoglycemia.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23789889/),"
The threshold-suspend feature of sensor-augmented insulin pumps is designed to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia by interrupting insulin delivery at a preset sensor glucose value. We evaluated sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy with and without the threshold-suspend feature in patients with nocturnal hypoglycemia.
We randomly assigned patients with type 1 diabetes and documented nocturnal hypoglycemia to receive sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy with or without the threshold-suspend feature for 3 months. The primary safety outcome was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level. The primary efficacy outcome was the area under the curve (AUC) for nocturnal hypoglycemic events. Two-hour threshold-suspend events were analyzed with respect to subsequent sensor glucose values.
A total of 247 patients were randomly assigned to receive sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy with the threshold-suspend feature (threshold-suspend group, 121 patients) or standard sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy (control group, 126 patients). The changes in glycated hemoglobin values were similar in the two groups. The mean AUC for nocturnal hypoglycemic events was 37.5% lower in the threshold-suspend group than in the control group (980 ± 1200 mg per deciliter [54.4 ± 66.6 mmol per liter] × minutes vs. 1568 ± 1995 mg per deciliter [87.0 ± 110.7 mmol per liter] × minutes, P<0.001). Nocturnal hypoglycemic events occurred 31.8% less frequently in the threshold-suspend group than in the control group (1.5 ± 1.0 vs. 2.2 ± 1.3 per patient-week, P<0.001). The percentages of nocturnal sensor glucose values of less than 50 mg per deciliter (2.8 mmol per liter), 50 to less than 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter), and 60 to less than 70 mg per deciliter (3.9 mmol per liter) were significantly reduced in the threshold-suspend group (P<0.001 for each range). After 1438 instances at night in which the pump was stopped for 2 hours, the mean sensor glucose value was 92.6 ± 40.7 mg per deciliter (5.1 ± 2.3 mmol per liter). Four patients (all in the control group) had a severe hypoglycemic event; no patients had diabetic ketoacidosis.
This study showed that over a 3-month period the use of sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy with the threshold-suspend feature reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia, without increasing glycated hemoglobin values. (Funded by Medtronic MiniMed; ASPIRE ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01497938.).

Insulin bolusing software: the potential to optimize health outcomes in type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23759397/),"
Insulin bolusing calculators alleviate the burden of having to calculate insulin bolus doses for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Three important pieces of information are needed: a blood glucose monitoring (BGM) result, carbohydrates to be consumed, and the amount of insulin bolus delivered. The purpose of this study was to describe insulin pump adherence behaviors associated with the use of bolus calculators in youth who use Medtronic insulin pumps.
Data were downloaded from the MiniMed Paradigm insulin pumps (Medtronic) of 31 youth with T1DM. Areas of adherence that were evaluated included fundamental insulin pump adherence behaviors (e.g., BGM, carbohydrate entry, and insulin bolusing), decisions about Wizard® recommendations, and three Wizard steps: BGM result-carbohydrate input-insulin bolus.
On average, patients conducted BGM ≥4 times/day on 69% of days, inputted carbohydrates ≥3 times/day on 63% of days, and insulin bolused ≥3 times/day on 85% of days. Participants generally followed Wizard recommendations. Finally, participants completed all three Wizard steps (BGM, carbohydrate input, insulin bolus) within 30 min for an average of 29% of boluses. Almost 3% of boluses that were preceded by Wizard use were delivered without conducting BGM or inputting carbohydrates.
There was substantial variability in insulin pump adherence behaviors (e.g., days when no BGM occurred, reliance on basal insulin). Interventions targeting insulin pump adherence behaviors have the potential to optimize diabetes health outcomes and glycemic control. Improving insulin pump software reports is one promising avenue for improving adherence.

We evaluated the long-term glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes, using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for at least 5 years in three diabetes centers from three different countries: Canada, Italy and Spain. This was an observational retrospective multicenter cohort study. Subjects were included if they were followed at one of the participating centers, had type 1 diabetes, age 5-20 years at time of data collection and used CSII for more than 5 years. Data collected included gender, age, disease duration, age at CSII initiation, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin requirement and serious adverse events (SAE) at baseline and every 12 months during follow-up. One hundred fifteen patients were included in the study (55% males), aged 5-20 years (mean: 13.5 ± 3.8 years), with mean diabetes duration of 6.3 ± 3.4 years, using CSII for mean of 6.9 ± 1.2 years (range 5-12 years.). HbA1c significantly improved after 1 year of CSII treatment and during follow-up (p = 0.02). When HbA1c was compared between countries, a difference was observed, with slightly lower values in Italy than in Canada and Spain (p = 0.04). When evaluated by gender, HbA1c was similar at baseline, but significantly improved only in males during all follow-up (p = 0.004). No significant differences were observed for BMI, insulin requirement or SAE. Insulin pump therapy is safe and effective in the pediatric population, although in this study, the major benefit in HbA1c was seen in males. The use of advanced pump features was associated with greater improvement in HbA1c.

Patch pump versus conventional pump: postprandial glycemic excursions and the influence of wear time.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23650901/),"
The aim of this study was to compare blood glucose and plasma insulin profiles after bolus insulin infusion by a patch pump (PP) versus a conventional pump (CP), directly after placement and after Day 3 of use.
Twenty patients with type 1 diabetes came in for two blocks of visits: one block of two visits while wearing the OmniPod® (Insulet Corp., Bedford, MA) insulin pump (PP) and one block of two visits while wearing the Medtronic Diabetes (Northridge, CA) Paradigm® pump (CP). Patients administered an identical mealtime insulin bolus of at least 6 IU.
For PP, maximum glucose levels were 28.7% lower on Day 3 (P=0.020), when maximum insulin levels were 30.3% higher (P=0.002). For CP, maximum glucose levels were 26.5% lower on Day 3 (P=0.015), when maximum insulin levels were 46.4% higher (P=0.003). Glucose levels (mean [interquartile range]) were significantly lower on Day 3 for PP (168.2 [145.8] mg/dL vs. 139.4 [77.8] mg/dL; P=0.013), but not significantly so for CP (159.0 [66.1] mg/dL vs. 139.5 [57.9] mg/dL; P=0.084). Mean insulin levels were significantly higher on Day 3 for CP (195 [120] pmol/L vs. 230 [90] pmol/L; P=0.01), but not significantly so for PP (178 [106] pmol/L vs. 194 [120] pmol/L; P=0.099). There were no significant differences between the two catheter lengths.
Postprandial glycemic excursions were lower on Day 3 of catheter wear time, but there were no differences between PPs and CPs. These findings support the proposal that catheter wear time plays an important role in insulin absorption.

Model-based sensor-augmented pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23567006/),"
In insulin pump therapy, optimization of bolus and basal insulin dose settings is a challenge. We introduce a new algorithm that provides individualized basal rates and new carbohydrate ratio and correction factor recommendations. The algorithm utilizes a mathematical model of blood glucose (BG) as a function of carbohydrate intake and delivered insulin, which includes individualized parameters derived from sensor BG and insulin delivery data downloaded from a patient's pump.
A mathematical model of BG as a function of carbohydrate intake and delivered insulin was developed. The model includes fixed parameters and several individualized parameters derived from the subject's BG measurements and pump data. Performance of the new algorithm was assessed using n = 4 diabetic canine experiments over a 32 h duration. In addition, 10 in silico adults from the University of Virginia/Padova type 1 diabetes mellitus metabolic simulator were tested.
The percentage of time in glucose range 80-180 mg/dl was 86%, 85%, 61%, and 30% using model-based therapy and [78%, 100%] (brackets denote multiple experiments conducted under the same therapy and animal model), [75%, 67%], 47%, and 86% for the control experiments for dogs 1 to 4, respectively. The BG measurements obtained in the simulation using our individualized algorithm were in 61-231 mg/dl min-max envelope, whereas use of the simulator's default treatment resulted in BG measurements 90-210 mg/dl min-max envelope.
The study results demonstrate the potential of this method, which could serve as a platform for improving, facilitating, and standardizing insulin pump therapy based on a single download of data.

The mySentry system (Medtronic Inc.) is the first to amplify and relay continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pump data to a remote site within the house. Its usability and acceptability were evaluated in families having a child with type 1 diabetes.
Each enrolled family included a child (age 7-17 years) who used a Paradigm REAL-Time Revel sensor-augmented insulin pump (Medtronic). After a 1-week run-in phase, families set up and used the mySentry system for a 3-week study phase. Opinion surveys were completed by parents, and pump and CGM data were collected and analyzed retrospectively. No formal hypothesis testing was performed, and the study was not powered to detect changes in nocturnal glycemia.
Thirty-five families completed the study. Enrolled children (61.1% female) had a mean (± standard deviation) age of 11.9 ± 2.70 years and a mean age at initiation of pump therapy of 7.1 ± 3.19 years. Baseline survey results indicated that most parents were fearful of their unawareness of their children's nocturnal glucose excursions. The mySentry system met the predefined acceptability criteria for general experience, product usability, and training materials. There were no unanticipated device-related adverse effects. Among children who experienced nocturnal hypo- or hyperglycemic episodes in both phases of the study, there was a trend toward less frequent and less prolonged episodes during mySentry use.
The mySentry system met all predefined criteria for acceptability and did not demonstrate safety issues. Alerting parents to abnormal glucose values or trends may attenuate nocturnal hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia by prompting appropriate and timely intervention.

Disordered eating behaviors in youth with type 1 diabetes: prospective pilot assessment following initiation of insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23550556/),"
There is risk for disordered eating behaviors in type 1 diabetes, especially related to insulin manipulation. Implementation of insulin pump therapy may encourage either normalization of eating behaviors or a greater focus on food intake due to renewed emphasis on carbohydrate counting. There is need for prospective studies to assess disordered eating behaviors upon implementation of pump therapy using diabetes-specific measurement tools.
In a multicenter pilot study, 43 youth with type 1 diabetes, 10-17 years old, were assessed prior to pump initiation and after 1 and 6 months of pump therapy. Youth completed the Diabetes-specific Eating Problems Survey-Revised (DEPS-R), a validated measure of risk for both diabetes-specific and general disordered eating behaviors.
Youth (45% female), 13.3 years old with diabetes for 2.1 years, had a mean hemoglobin A1c of 8.3±1.3% (68±14.5 mmol/mol) at baseline. DEPS-R scores decreased over time (P=0.01). Overall rate of high risk for eating disorders was low. Overweight/obese youth endorsed more disordered eating behaviors than normal-weight participants. DEPS-R scores were correlated with z-score for body mass index at all three time points and with hemoglobin A1c after 1 and 6 months. Hemoglobin A1c did not change significantly over the 6 months and was higher in overweight/obese compared with normal-weight participants.
Initiation of insulin pump therapy was associated with diminished endorsement of disordered eating behaviors in youth with type 1 diabetes. Longer follow-up studies are needed to assess the impact of insulin pump therapy on glycemic control, weight status, and disordered eating behaviors in this vulnerable population.

This study examined long-term effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in clinical practice on glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes.
We evaluated all type 1 diabetes patients at 10 diabetes outpatient clinics in Sweden who had been treated with CSII for at least 5.5 years and had valid glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) data before starting pump use and at 5 years ± 6 months. Controls treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) over a time-matched period were also evaluated.
There were 331 patients treated with CSII at least 5.5 years at the 10 clinics. Of these, 272 (82%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Patients treated with CSII were younger than those treated with MDI (mean age, 38.6 vs. 45.6 years; P<0.001), more were women (56% vs. 43%; P<0.001), and diabetes duration was shorter (mean, 15.1 years vs. 20.1 years; P<0.001). After adjusting for variables differing at baseline and influencing the change in HbA1c over the study period, the reduction in HbA1c remained statistically significant at 5 years and was estimated to be 0.20% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.32) (2.17 mmol/mol [95% CI 0.81-3.53]) (P=0.002). The corresponding adjusted reduction at years 1 and 2 was 0.42% (95% CI 0.31-0.53) (4.59 mmol/mol [95% CI 3.41-5.77]) (P<0.001) and 0.43% (95% CI 0.31-0.55) (4.71 mmol/mol [95% CI 3.38-6.04]) (P<0.001), respectively. The effect of insulin pump use versus controls on HbA1c decreased significantly with time (P<0.001).

Sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy can improve glycemic control, compared with multiple daily insulin injections or with insulin pump therapy alone, without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia.
A 12-month observational study in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), upon the introduction of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), was conducted in 15 countries (in Europe and in Israel) to document the real-life use of SAP and assess which variables are associated with improvement in type 1 diabetes management.
Data from 263 patients (38% male; mean age, 28.0 ± 15.7 years [range, 1-69 years]; body mass index, 23.3 ± 4.9 kg/m(2); diabetes duration, 13.9 ± 10.7 years; CSII duration, 2.6 ± 3 years) were collected. Baseline mean glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 8.1 ± 1.4%; 82% had suboptimal HbA1c (≥ 7%). The average sensor use for 12 months was 30% (range, 0-94%), and sensor use decreased with time (first 3 months, 37%; last 3 months, 27%). Factors associated with improvement in HbA1c after 12 months in patients with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7% were high baseline HbA1c (P<0.001), older age group (P<0.001), and more frequent sensor use (P = 0.047). Significantly less hospitalization, increased treatment satisfaction, and reduced fear of hypoglycemia were reported after 12 months of SAP.
This is the largest and longest multicenter prospective observational study providing real-life data on SAP. These results are consistent with those of controlled trials showing the effectiveness of CGM in pump users.

Effect of infusion rate and indwelling time on tissue resistance pressure in small-volume subcutaneous infusion like in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23427865/),"
To deliver exact volumes of liquid subcutaneously (e.g., during continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]), the insulin pump has to overcome not only frictional losses of the mechanical drive and pressure losses in the tubing and infusion set, but also the tissue resistance pressure (TRP). Up to now, detailed information about the dependence of TRP on volumes and delivery rates common for CSII is missing. However, knowledge of the typical range of TRP during CSII is important to optimize occlusion detection and the design of insulin pumps.
TRP was examined in 24 subjects (12 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and long-term CSII therapy and 12 subjects without diabetes) while subcutaneously infusing a liquid test solution via infusion sets with 8-mm steel cannulas using four different infusion rates (infused volume, 0.3 mL of saline solution). The primary objectives were to estimate the TRP and its dependence on the infusion rate, as well as the impact of the cannula indwelling time of roughly 80 h.
Stepwise increases in the infusion rate were associated with significant rises in median TRP: 0.01 mL/min (= 1 U/min for U100 insulin), 8.09 mbar; 0.05 mL/min, 18.28 mbar; 0.1 mL/min, 25.18 mbar; and 0.5 mL/min, 62.59 mbar. No statistically significant changes in TRP could be attributed to the catheter indwelling time of roughly 80 h.
Median TRP increased significantly with higher infusion rates. Catheter indwelling time had no significant effect on the TRP. Occlusion detection may be improved by using rate-dependent detection thresholds.

The present study formed part of a larger study examining the potential long-term effects of glycaemic control and treatment satisfaction in people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus who changed from multiple daily insulin injections to insulin pump therapy. Individuals (n = 46) who made the transition between May 1999 and February 2004 participated. The aim of the study was to describe experiences of the impact of insulin pump therapy in adults with Type 1 diabetes mellitus after > 5 years' use of an insulin pump.
During spring 2009, 16 of the individuals were interviewed through a narrative approach on the effects of insulin pump therapy on daily life. The interviews were analysed using content analysis.
The overarching theme revealed that insulin pump therapy was experienced as both a shackle and a lifeline. Six sub-themes emerged: subjected vs. empowered; dependent vs. autonomous; vulnerable vs. strengthened; routinized vs. flexible; burdened vs. relieved; and stigmatized vs. normalized.
Users of insulin pump therapy have different views about and experience of having used the technical equipment over years. Both positive and negative views emerged. However, it is difficult to identify any general trends that cover all views and can predict which individuals will be able to manage pump therapy in the best way. Even so, the sub-themes and theme that emerged could be used by physicians and diabetes specialist nurses when counselling and planning educational programmes aimed at supporting self-management among people with insulin pump treatment.

The objective of this study was to assess changes for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes using a pump in terms of quality of life (QOL), satisfaction, and glycosylated hemoglobin. A retrospective self-evaluation questionnaire was distributed to 41 patients. It focused on general QOL, diabetes-specific QOL supplemented by specific questions on the pump, and satisfaction. Clinical and biological parameters (glycated hemoglobin: HbA1c) were compared before and after pump use. The score for QOL with the pump was positive, more so if started early after diagnosis of diabetes (P=0.03) and with children under the age of 8 years (P<0.02). These positive results are mainly related to the characteristics of the pump, ""insulin management"" and ""injections,"" as well as ""diabetes management,"" ""behavior,"" ""school,"" ""family life,"" ""daily life,"" and ""physical activities."" On the other hand, the improvement was not significant for the item ""life in society, friends and family."" A decrease in the number of injections and the flexibility of meals were the most positive points. HbA1c improved as soon as the pump was indicated before its use was begun (P=0.005) and remained constant for 4 years (P≤0.05). Forgotten injections, comments on diabetes, and technical problems appeared to be exceptional. The pump changed the patient's body image because of ambivalent feelings between being normal (greater freedom) and different (visibility and a reminder of the disease). The benefits in terms of QOL and glycemic control with the pump cannot be dissociated and can only be considered accompanied by paramedical and medical assistance. Improving QOL over the short and long term by reducing the risk of further complications is the daily challenge of families and diabetologists.

Evidence of a strong association between frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels in T1D exchange clinic registry participants.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23378621/),"
Despite substantial evidence of the benefit of frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in type 1 diabetes, certain insurers limit the number of test strips that they will provide. The large database of the T1D Exchange clinic registry provided an opportunity to evaluate the relationship between the number of SMBG measurements per day and HbA1c levels across a wide age range of children and adults.
The analysis included 20,555 participants in the T1D Exchange clinic registry with type 1 diabetes â‰¥1 year and not using a continuous glucose monitor (11,641 younger than age 18 years and 8,914 18 years old or older). General linear models were used to assess the association between the number of SMBG measurements and HbA1c levels after adjusting for potential confounding variables.
A higher number of SMBG measurements per day were associated with non-Hispanic white race, insurance coverage, higher household income, and use of an insulin pump for insulin delivery (P < 0.001 for each factor). After adjusting for these factors, a higher number of SMBG measurements per day was strongly associated with a lower HbA1c level (adjusted P < 0.001), with the association being present in all age-groups and in both insulin pump and injection users.
There is a strong association between higher SMBG frequency and lower HbA1c levels. It is important for insurers to consider that reducing restrictions on the number of test strips provided per month may lead to improved glycemic control for some patients with type 1 diabetes.

Social determinants of health on glycemic control in pediatric type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23360562/),"
To evaluate the relationship between the social determinants of health (SDH) and glycemic control in a large pediatric type 1 diabetes (T1D) population.
Deprivation Indices (DI) were used to ascertain population-level measures of socioeconomic status, family structure, and ethnicity in patients with T1D followed at The Hospital for Sick Children August 2010-2011 (n = 854). DI quintile scores were determined for individual patients based on de-identified postal codes, and linked to mean patient A1Cs as a measure of glycemic control. We compared mean A1C between the most and least deprived DI quintiles. Associations were estimated controlling for age and sex, and repeated for insulin pump use.
The T1D population evaluated in this study was most concentrated in the least and most deprived quintiles of the Material DI. A1C levels were highest in patients with the greatest degree of deprivation (fifth vs first quintile) on the Material DI (9.2% vs 8.3%, P < .0001), Social DI (9.1% vs 8.3%, P < .0001), and Ethnic Concentration Index (8.9% vs 8.4%, P = .03). These relationships between measures of the SDH and A1C were not evident for patients on insulin pumps. On regression analysis, higher A1C was predicted by older age, female sex, not using pump therapy, and being in the most deprived quintile for Material and Social Deprivation, but not Ethnic Concentration.
Measures of the SDH comprising Material and Social Deprivation were significantly associated with suboptimal glycemic control in our pediatric T1D cohort. Use of insulin pump therapy also predicted A1C and may have a moderating effect on these relationships.

The effect of using the insulin pump bolus calculator compared to standard insulin dosage calculations in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus - systematic review.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23329581/),"
Modern insulin pumps use bolus calculators to determine the appropriate insulin dose to facilitate achievement of glycaemic targets.To summarize the data on insulin pump bolus calculators compared to standard insulin dosage calculations and the impact on glycaemic profile.The MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Library databases were searched until October 2012 for related randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies performed in type 1 diabetes. A meta-analysis of RCTs was conducted.We included 6 trials comprising 354 subjects. Combined data of 2 RCTs showed significantly smaller number of correction boluses in the experimental group (MD - 2.31; 95% CI: - 3.59 to - 1.03; p=0.0004) and a trend toward fewer hypoglycaemic episodes per week (MD - 0.47; from - 0.95 to 0.02; 95% CI; p=0.06) in the experimental group compared to control subjects. Other authors reported significant reduction in daily post-prandial blood glucose values in the experimental group compared to controls. The authors observed only one adverse event. More frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose in the experimental group was reported in 3 trials. There were no differences in HbA1c within the groups. Patients were satisfied with the treatment with bolus calculator, according to the treatment satisfaction scale.Insulin pump bolus calculators are effective and safe in prandial insulin calculation with a positive impact on glucose profile.

Frequency of mealtime insulin bolus as a proxy measure of adherence for children and youths with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23317372/),"
Electronic measures of adherence can be superior to patient report. In type 1 diabetes, frequency of blood glucose monitoring (BGM), as measured by patients' home blood glucose meters, has already been identified as a valid proxy of adherence. We present methodology to calculate adherence using insulin pump records and evaluate the reliability and validity of this methodology.
Blood glucose meter data, insulin pump records, and corresponding hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels were randomly gathered from clinical and research databases for 100 children and youths (referred to hereafter as youths) with type 1 diabetes (mean±SD age, 12.7±4.6 years). Youths' mean frequency of daily BGM was calculated. Additionally, we calculated a mean mealtime insulin bolus score (BOLUS): youths received 1 point each for a bolus between 0600 and 1000 h, 1100 and 1500 h, and 1600 and 2200 h (maximum of 1 point/meal or 3 points/day).
Simple correlations between youths' HbA1c level, age, frequency of BGM, and insulin BOLUS scores were all significant. Partial correlations and multiple regression analyses revealed that insulin BOLUS scores better explain variations in HbA1c levels than the electronically recorded frequency of daily blood glucose measures.
Our procedures for calculating insulin BOLUS scores using insulin pump records demonstrate better concurrent validity with youths' HbA1c levels than that of the frequency of BGM with youths' HbA1c levels. Our analyses have shown that insulin bolus scoring was superior to the frequency of BGM in predicting youths' HbA1c levels.

Glycaemic variability in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI): a cross-sectional cohort study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23134485/),"
This cross-sectional observational cohort study was designed to investigate i) whether glycaemic variability in paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes is lower in those using an insulin pump (CSII) compared with those using multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) and ii) whether urinary F2 -isoprostanes and/or urinary prostaglandin F2 excretion as surrogate marker of oxidative stress and cyclooxygenase activity are associated with glycaemic variability.
48 paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes (22 using an insulin pump) underwent an ambulatory 3-day continuous glucose monitoring. All patients continued with normal daily activities and collected urine for two consecutive 24 h periods. The glucose pentagon was used to calculate the glycaemic risk parameter.
Insulin requirements, HDL-cholesterol, the mean of glycaemic excursions (P < 0·01) and the standard deviation of mean glucose concentration (P < 0·05) were significantly lower in patients with CSII compared with those using MDI. By contrast, averaged HbA1c during the last twelve months as well as at the time of sensor insertion did not differ significantly between both groups. Summarizing characteristic parameter of acute and long-term metabolic control into the glucose pentagon revealed a significantly lower glycaemic risk parameter in CSI patients compared with both, healthy subjects and patients using MDI (P < 0·05).
Paediatric patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump presented with lower glycaemic variability and a concomitantly lower glycaemic risk parameter compared with those using MDII. Whether these findings translate into a lower risk of diabetes associated cardiovascular complications remains to be elucidated.

More than 375,000 Americans manage their diabetes with an insulin pump, and this number continues to increase. Many of these patients will want to remain on their insulin pump while hospitalized, so the nurse needs to know about how to care for the hospitalized patient wearing an insulin pump. This article discusses the benefits of intensive insulin therapy, how the insulin pump works, initial insulin-pump dosing, candidate selection, advantages and disadvantages of using an insulin pump, troubleshooting the pump, nursing care of the hospitalized patient wearing an insulin pump, and development of hospital protocols for the care of such patients.

Improving the computational effort of set-inversion-based prandial insulin delivery for its integration in insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23294789/),"
Set-inversion-based prandial insulin delivery is a new model-based bolus advisor for postprandial glucose control in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). It automatically coordinates the values of basal-bolus insulin to be infused during the postprandial period so as to achieve some predefined control objectives. However, the method requires an excessive computation time to compute the solution set of feasible insulin profiles, which impedes its integration into an insulin pump. In this work, a new algorithm is presented, which reduces computation time significantly and enables the integration of this new bolus advisor into current processing features of smart insulin pumps.
A new strategy was implemented that focused on finding the combined basal-bolus solution of interest rather than an extensive search of the feasible set of solutions. Analysis of interval simulations, inclusion of physiological assumptions, and search domain contractions were used. Data from six real patients with T1DM were used to compare the performance between the optimized and the conventional computations.
In all cases, the optimized version yielded the basal-bolus combination recommended by the conventional method and in only 0.032% of the computation time. Simulations show that the mean number of iterations for the optimized computation requires approximately 3.59 s at 20 MHz processing power, in line with current features of smart pumps.
A computationally efficient method for basal-bolus coordination in postprandial glucose control has been presented and tested. The results indicate that an embedded algorithm within smart insulin pumps is now feasible. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that a clinical trial will be needed in order to justify this claim.

An online failure detection method of the glucose sensor-insulin pump system: improved overnight safety of type-1 diabetic subjects.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23193300/),"
Sensors for real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) have opened new scenarios for Type-1 diabetes treatment. However, occasional failures of either CGM or CSII may expose diabetic patients to possibly severe risks, especially overnight (e.g., inappropriate insulin administration). In this contribution, we present a method to detect in real time such failures by simultaneously using CGM and CSII data streams and a black-box model of the glucose-insulin system. First, an individualized state-space model of the glucose-insulin system is identified offline from CGM and CSII data collected during a previous monitoring. Then, this model, CGM and CSII real-time data streams are used online to obtain predictions of future glucose concentrations together with their confidence intervals by exploiting a Kalman filtering approach. If glucose values measured by the CGM sensor are not consistent with the predictions, a failure alert is generated in order to mitigate the risks for patient safety. The method is tested on 100 virtual patients created by using the UVA/Padova Type-1 diabetic simulator. Three different types of failures have been simulated: spike in the CGM profile, loss of sensitivity of glucose sensor, and failure in the pump delivery of insulin. Results show that, in all cases, the method is able to correctly generate alerts, with a very limited number of false negatives and a number of false positives, on average, lower than 10%. The use of the method in three subjects supports the simulation results, demonstrating that the accuracy of the method in generating alerts in presence of failures of the CGM sensor-CSII pump system can significantly improve safety of Type-1 diabetic patients overnight.

Patient time costs associated with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy for type 1 diabetes: results from the STAR 3 randomized trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23128579/),"
Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT) leads to lower glycated hemoglobin levels than multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) in patients with type 1 diabetes. Patient time and costs associated with SAPT are not known.
We compared time spent on diabetes-related care, changes in time, and associated patient time costs between patients randomly assigned to SAPT or MDI. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS. During a 52-week clinical trial, participants aged 7 to 70 years (n = 483) reported total time per week spent on diabetes-related care.
Patient time, including comparisons during pump initiation, 52-week patient time costs, and changes in weekly time estimates after pump initiation.
At baseline, patients in the MDI group reported spending an average of 4.0 hours per week on diabetes-related care. During the pump initiation period (weeks 1-7), SAPT patients spent 1.9 hours more per week than MDI patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-2.6). After the initiation period (weeks 8-52), SAPT patients spent 1 hour more per week (95% CI, 0.4-1.7) than MDI patients (i.e., 4.4 v. 3.4 hours); patients in both groups spent progressively less time on diabetes-related care by 1.2 minutes per week (95% CI, -1.7 to -0.7). Overall, mean time costs per person were $4600 with the SAPT group and $3523 with the MDI group (difference, $1077; 95% CI, $491-$1638).
Time spent on specific activities was not collected, and the estimates do not explicitly account for caregiver time associated with diabetes care activities.
Patients receiving SAPT v. MDI spent approximately 2 hours more per week on diabetes-related care during pump initiation and 1 hour more per week thereafter, resulting in higher patient time costs.

Inpatient studies of a Kalman-filter-based predictive pump shutoff algorithm.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063041/),"
An insulin pump shutoff system can prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and is a first step on the pathway toward a closed-loop artificial pancreas. In previous pump shutoff studies using a voting algorithm and a 1 min continuous glucose monitor (CGM), 80% of induced hypoglycemic events were prevented.
The pump shutoff algorithm used in previous studies was revised to a single Kalman filter to reduce complexity, incorporate CGMs with different sample times, handle sensor signal dropouts, and enforce safety constraints on the allowable pump shutoff time.
Retrospective testing of the new algorithm on previous clinical data sets indicated that, for the four cases where the previous algorithm failed (minimum reference glucose less than 60 mg/dl), the mean suspension start time was 30 min earlier than the previous algorithm. Inpatient studies of the new algorithm have been conducted on 16 subjects. The algorithm prevented hypoglycemia in 73% of subjects. Suspension-induced hyperglycemia is not assessed, because this study forced excessive basal insulin infusion rates.
The new algorithm functioned well and is flexible enough to handle variable sensor sample times and sensor dropouts. It also provides a framework for handling sensor signal attenuations, which can be challenging, particularly when they occur overnight.

Robust fault detection system for insulin pump therapy using continuous glucose monitoring.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063040/),"
The popularity of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), or insulin pump therapy, as a way to deliver insulin more physiologically and achieve better glycemic control in diabetes patients has increased. Despite the substantiated therapeutic advantages of using CSII, its use has also been associated with an increased risk of technical malfunctioning of the device, which leads to an increased risk of acute metabolic complications, such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Current insulin pumps already incorporate systems to detect some types of faults, such as obstructions in the infusion set, but are not able to detect other types of fault such as the disconnection or leakage of the infusion set.
In this article, we propose utilizing a validated robust model-based fault detection technique, based on interval analysis, for detecting disconnections of the insulin infusion set. For this purpose, a previously validated metabolic model of glucose regulation in type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and a continuous glucose monitoring device were used. As a first step to assess the performance of the presented fault detection system, a Food and Drug Administration-accepted T1DM simulator was employed.
Of the 100 in silico tests (10 scenarios on 10 subjects), only two false negatives and one false positive occurred. All faults were detected before plasma glucose concentration reached 300 mg/dl, with a mean plasma glucose detection value of 163 mg/dl and a mean detection time of 200 min.
Interval model-based fault detection has been proven (in silico) to be an effective tool for detecting disconnection faults in sensor-augmented CSII systems. Proper quantification of the uncertainty associated with the employed model has been observed to be crucial for the good performance of the proposed approach.

Pediatric use of insulin pump technology: a retrospective study of adverse events in children ages 1-12 years.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063031/),"
Growing technological improvements in insulin pump design have increased the use of these devices in young children. To better understand the types of infusion pump-related problems and associated adverse events in this age group, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of pump-related adverse event reports received by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for children ages 1-12 years.
A query was conducted of FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from January 1, 1996, through December 31, 2009, in children ages 1-12 years involving insulin pumps. Report narratives were individually reviewed for age, gender, and seriousness of outcomes. Device or patient problems and potential contributory factors were assessed.
Over the past 14 years, 1774 (7%) of all insulin pump adverse event reports were identified in children ages 1-12. Of these reports, 777 (43%) resulted in hospitalization. In hospitalized cases (n = 614), diabetic ketoacidosis and/or hyperglycemia were the predominant patient problems, and in other cases (n = 98), hypoglycemia was evident. There were 106 emergency room visits, 19 cases requiring paramedic attention, and five deaths. The majority of reports indicated that the devices were not returned to the manufacturer, and root causes were not always confirmed.
Younger children with diabetes deserve careful consideration of the risk and benefit of insulin pump technology. Studies are needed to better understand pediatric safety issues and to identify the root cause of adverse events. Problems related to patient education, device misuse, and malfunctions were found, highlighting the need to strengthen user training for children and their caregivers.

Insulin pump therapy in the perioperative period: a review of care after implementation of institutional guidelines.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063026/),"
An institutional policy was previously established for patients with diabetes on insulin pump therapy undergoing elective surgical procedures.
Electronic medical records were reviewed to assess documentation of insulin pump status and glucose monitoring during preoperative, intraoperative, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) phases of care.
Twenty patients with insulin pumps underwent 23 procedures from March 1 to December 31, 2011. Mean (standard deviation) age was 58 (13) years, mean diabetes duration was 28 (17) years, and mean duration of insulin pump therapy was 7 (6) years. Nearly all cases (86%) during the preoperative phase had the presence of the device documented--an improvement over the 64% noted in data collected before the policy. Intraoperatively, 13 cases (61%) had the presence of the pump documented, which was higher than the 28% before implementation of the policy. However, documentation of pump status was found in only 38% in the PACU and was actually less than the 60% documented previously. Over 90% of cases had glucose checked in the preoperative area and the PACU, and only 60% had it checked intraoperatively, which was nearly identical to the percentages seen before policy implementation. No adverse events occurred when insulin pump therapy was continued.
Although some processes still require improvement, preliminary data suggest that the policy for perioperative management of insulin pumps has provided useful structure for care of these cases. The data thus far indicate that insulin pump therapy can be continued safely during the perioperative period.

Comparison of insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) to alternative methods for perioperative glycemic management in patients with planned postoperative admissions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23063025/),"
Patients with diabetes who use insulin pumps [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] undergo surgeries that require postoperative hospital admission. There are no defined guidelines for CSII perioperative use.
This retrospective single-institution study identified type 1 and type 2 diabetes subjects by electronically searching 2005-2010 anesthesia preoperative assessments for ""pump."" Surgical cases (n = 92) were grouped according to intraoperative insulin delivery method: (a) CSII continuation of basal rate with/without correctional insulin bolus(es) (n = 53); (b) conversion to intravenous insulin infusion (n = 20); and (c) CSII suspension with/without correctional insulin bolus(es) (n = 19). These groups were compared on mean intraoperative blood glucose (BG) and category of most extreme intraoperative BG.
Differences were found on baseline characteristics of diabetes duration (p = .010), anesthesia time (p = .011), proportions receiving general anesthesia (p = .013), and preoperative BG (p = .033). The conversion group had the longest diabetes duration and anesthesia time; it had a higher proportion of general anesthesia recipients and a higher mean preoperative BG than the continuation group. There was no significant difference in mean BG/surgical case between continuation (163.5 ± 58.5 mg/dl), conversion (152.3 ± 28.9 mg/dl), and suspension groups (188.3 ± 44.9 mg/dl; p = .128). The suspension group experienced a greater percentage of cases (84.2%) with one or more intraoperative BG > 179 mg/dl than continuation (45.3%) and conversion (40%) groups Figure 1 groupings (p = .034).
In this limited sample, preliminary findings are consistent with similar intraoperative glycemic control between CSII continuation and CSII conversion to intravenous insulin infusions. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion suspension had a greater rate of hyperglycemia. Preoperative differences between insulin delivery groups complicate interpretations of findings.

We reviewed the care of a large cohort of patients with diabetes mellitus on insulin pump therapy who required an inpatient stay.
Records were reviewed of patients hospitalized between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2011.
A total of 136 patients using insulin pumps had 253 hospitalizations. Mean (standard deviation) patient age was 55 (16) years, diabetes duration was 29 (15) years, and pump duration was 6 (5) years. Insulin pump therapy was continued in 164 (65%) hospitalizations. Adherence to core process measures improved over time: by 2011, 100% of cases had an endocrinology consultation, 100% had the required insulin pump order set completed, and 94% had documentation of the signed agreement specifying patient responsibilities for continued use of the technology while hospitalized. Documentation of the insulin pump flow sheet also increased but could still be located in only 64% of cases by the end of 2011. Mean glucose was not significantly different among patients who remained on insulin pump therapy compared to those for whom it was discontinued (p > .1), but episodes of severe hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dl) and hypoglycemia (<40 mg/dl) were significantly less common among pump users. No pump site infections, mechanical pump failures, or episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis were observed among patients remaining on therapy.
With appropriate patient selection and usage guidelines, most patients using insulin pumps can safely have their therapy transitioned to the inpatient setting. Further study is needed to determine whether this approach can be translated to other hospital settings.

Morbidity and mortality of diabetic ketoacidosis with and without insulin pump care.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23009106/),"
Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is one of the most common, costly, and dangerous acute complications in people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Although DKA has been reported to occur with less frequency than severe hypoglycemia, it is associated with a higher mortality rate and is the leading cause of diabetes-related deaths in children and adolescents. The most common risk factor for DKA is lack of adherence to insulin treatment. Other factors include underinsurance, psychiatric disorders, occlusion of insulin pump infusion sets, and illness. It has been suggested that use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy may increase the risk for DKA, although clinical trials have not supported this claim. Expert care within a T1D specialty clinic may help reduce the risk of DKA mortality. Further advances are needed in developing new technologies and methods to improve glycemic control in intensively treated patients without increasing the risk of acute complications. The purpose of this review is to discuss DKA morbidity and mortality in youth with T1D, particularly in relation to insulin pump use.

Insulin infusion set: the Achilles heel of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22920824/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion from an insulin pump depends on reliable transfer of the pumped insulin to the subcutaneous insulin depot by means of an insulin infusion set (IIS). Despite their widespread use, the published knowledge about IISs and related issues regarding the impact of placement and wear time on insulin absorption/insulin action is relatively small. We also have to acknowledge that our knowledge is limited with regard to how often patients encounter issues with IISs. Reading pump wearer blogs, for instance, suggests that these are a frequent source of trouble. There are no prospective clinical studies available on current IIS and insulin formulations that provide representative data on the type and frequency of issues with infusion sets. The introduction of new IISs and patch pumps may foster a reassessment of available products and of patient problems related to their use. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge and recommendations about IISs and to highlight potential directions of IIS development in order to make insulin absorption safer and more efficient.

Early morning hyperglycemia is frequent among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Reasons are a dawn phenomenon, a Somogyi phenomenon or a lack of insulin in the morning hours. Only few studies are published regarding incidence and relation to different modes of basal insulin treatment in this population.We analyzed all cases recorded in the DPV register from 1995 to 2010. 5 839 patients from 128 centers with at least 3 blood glucose measurements during the last night of a hospital stay were included.24.2% of patients showed a morning hyperglycemia above 200 mg/dl. 8.6% showed a dawn phenomenon, 7.0 % a lack of insulin and 2.0% a Somogyi phenomenon. A dawn phenomenon was significantly less frequent in patients treated with an insulin pump (1.1%) compared to long acting insulin analogs Glargin and Levemir (5.4%) or NPH insulin (8.2%). Lack of insulin was again less frequent during insulin pump treatment compared to other treatments (1.9% vs. 4.9% vs. 5.3%). Median rise of blood glucose levels was 33.4 mg/dl between midnight and 6 a.m. Mode of basal insulin treatment is an important factor: while treatment with an insulin pump led to a blood glucose fall of 28.5 mg/dl between 3 and 6 a.m., treatment with insulin analog or NPH insulin resulted in a rise of 28.5 or 35.9 mg/dl, respectively.This study shows that insulin pump treatment reduces the frequency of morning hyperglycemia caused by the dawn phenomenon or a lack of insulin.

We conducted a prospective, one-year study of 15 subjects. Three medical visits took place: pre-baseline, baseline and at 6 months. Each month the subjects transmitted information from the glucose meter, glucose sensor and insulin pump. We adjusted the treatment and returned the information by email. We evaluated psychological and metabolic variables, including HbA(1c), hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia and glucose variability. At baseline the mean age of the subjects was 40 years and the mean duration of diabetes was 22 years. There was a significant reduction in HbA(1c) (7.50 to 6.97%) at 6 months, a significant increase in the number of self-monitoring blood glucose checks per day (5.2 to 6.2), and significant improvements in variability: MODD, mean of daily difference (67 to 53) and MAGE, mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions (136 to 102). There were significant improvements in quality of life (92 to 87), satisfaction with the treatment (34 to 32) and less fear of hypoglycaemia (36 to 32). Adult subjects with type 1 diabetes on treatment with a continuous insulin infusion system and a real time glucose sensor and who have acceptable metabolic control and optimized treatment can benefit from the addition of a telemetry system to their usual outpatient follow-up.

Patient perspectives on personalized glucose advisory systems for type 1 diabetes management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22856588/),"
Diabetes technology is rapidly advancing toward fully automated glucose control systems, but little is known about patient perspectives on these systems. This study aimed to gather qualitative and quantitative data on patient attitudes and concerns about using a personalized glucose advisory system (PGASystem) for diabetes management.
Fifty-six adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy participated in focus group interviews following use of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring for 4 weeks in a parent study to develop a PGASystem. Focus groups were transcribed and coded for thematic content.
All participants endorsed the desire to use a PGASystem, and the majority wanted advice from the system on all aspects of insulin delivery. However, participants indicated that they might be reluctant to follow such advice because of the following concerns: how the advice was generated, relinquishing control to automated technology, and inadequate personalization of the system. Participants believed the system would need to consider numerous factors related to their food, activities, and other personal information to provide optimally individualized advice. The majority also reported difficulties with behavioral event recording on their insulin pumps, and approximately one-third endorsed difficulty with accurate carbohydrate counting.
Adults with type 1 diabetes appear to be enthusiastic about using a PGASystem system for their diabetes management but also have significant concerns affecting their overall willingness to follow such a system's advice. Addressing these concerns will be crucial in the future development of glucose advisory and control technology.

Ramadan fasting in diabetes patients on insulin pump therapy augmented by continuous glucose monitoring: an observational real-life study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22827507/),"
Hypoglycemia during the daytime of Ramadan fasting is the most feared complication of diabetes. Insulin pump therapy has been proposed as the ideal ""theoretical"" method for insulin delivery. We report a prospective observational, single-center study of insulin-treated patients using insulin pump therapy during Ramadan 2011.
Twenty-one patients (10 males and 11 females) were selected; median age was 26 years. They adjusted their insulin as per their usual practices. Outcome measures obtained before and during Ramadan included body weight, glycosylated hemoglobin, blood glucose, total insulin dose differences, overriding tendency, suspension time during fasting, and number of hypoglycemic episodes.
The patients fasted for a median of 29 days. The observed changes during Ramadan were overall not significant quantitatively, but some trends were noted. The total insulin administered during Ramadan was not different from that in the pre-Ramadan period, but there was a redistribution of insulin over a 24-h period in relation to the changes in the daily lifestyle and eating patterns. Basal insulin was decreased during the daytime by 5-20% from before Ramadan and increased during the nighttime. The mean change in the overall amount of basal insulin was not significant. A larger than usual amount of insulin bolus was given at the meals Iftar, Fowala, and Suhur; the change in the total amount of bolus insulin as a percentage change from total insulin was also not significant. No major hypoglycemic episodes were reported. Minor hypoglcemic episodes were equally distributed between daytime and nighttime and were managed by either basal insulin adjustment or suspension from the pump.
This study confirms the advantages provided by insulin pump use in patients with diabetes were enhanced by the use of continuous glucose monitoring. We provided more evidence-based advice on how best to adjust the insulin pump during fasting.

Insulin doses before and one year after pump start: children have a reversed dawn phenomenon.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22768890/),"
We aimed to investigate the basal rate and bolus doses in children and adolescents at the start of insulin pump therapy and after 1 year of use.
Case records from 29 children and adolescents were examined. All pumps were started with rapid-acting insulin (Humalog). Patients were aged 13.1 ± 3.9 years, with a diabetes duration of 5.4 ± 4.1 years at pump start. Sixteen pumps were started for high hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; >8.8%, 73 mmol/mol) and 13 for other reasons.
Basal rates declined in both groups by 20% at 3 days after pump start. The bolus doses were reduced by 25-30% when the indication was high HbA1c and by 15% in the others. After 1 year, there was a significant difference in the basal rate between age groups. The 3-9-year-old age group had higher basal rates during the late evening (10:00 PM-12:00 AM), while the 15-21-year-old age group had higher basal rates in the early morning (3:00 AM-7:00 AM).
Insulin doses are reduced considerably when starting with a pump in pediatric practice. Younger children needed higher basal rates late in the evening (reversed dawn phenomenon), while older teenagers seem to need an increase in the morning, which may correspond to a true dawn phenomenon.

Fully integrated artificial pancreas in type 1 diabetes: modular closed-loop glucose control maintains near normoglycemia.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22688340/),"
Integrated closed-loop control (CLC), combining continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) with insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]), known as artificial pancreas, can help optimize glycemic control in diabetes. We present a fundamental modular concept for CLC design, illustrated by clinical studies involving 11 adolescents and 27 adults at the Universities of Virginia, Padova, and Montpellier. We tested two modular CLC constructs: standard control to range (sCTR), designed to augment pump plus CGM by preventing extreme glucose excursions; and enhanced control to range (eCTR), designed to truly optimize control within near normoglycemia of 3.9-10 mmol/L. The CLC system was fully integrated using automated data transfer CGM→algorithm→CSII. All studies used randomized crossover design comparing CSII versus CLC during identical 22-h hospitalizations including meals, overnight rest, and 30-min exercise. sCTR increased significantly the time in near normoglycemia from 61 to 74%, simultaneously reducing hypoglycemia 2.7-fold. eCTR improved mean blood glucose from 7.73 to 6.68 mmol/L without increasing hypoglycemia, achieved 97% in near normoglycemia and 77% in tight glycemic control, and reduced variability overnight. In conclusion, sCTR and eCTR represent sequential steps toward automated CLC, preventing extremes (sCTR) and further optimizing control (eCTR). This approach inspires compelling new concepts: modular assembly, sequential deployment, testing, and clinical acceptance of custom-built CLC systems tailored to individual patient needs.

[Benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22584198/),"
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial clearly demonstrated the benefits of blood glucose control, especially in children and adolescents, in the prevention of long-term complications of type 1 diabetes (T1D). This can be achieved with intensive insulin treatment with either multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), also known as insulin pump. The aim of this study was to compare glycemic control of T1D children treated with either CSII or MDI.
Thirty-eight T1D children treated with CSII were compared to 38 children treated with MDI, matched for age, gender, and duration of diabetes. Collected data, including daily doses of insulin in IU/kg/d, HbA1c levels, body mass index expressed in standard deviation/age, number of severe hypoglycemia episodes and of admissions related to T1D expressed in events/patient/year, were retrospectively collected every 3 months.
There was no difference between the 2 groups at baseline. During the 3 years of follow-up, patients treated with CSII had lower daily doses of insulin (0.78 ± 0.19 vs. 0.87 ± 0.22 IU/kg/d, p<0.05), significantly lower levels of HbA1c (7.5 ± 0.6 vs. 8.0 ± 1.3 %, p<0.05), and a decreased number of admissions related to T1D (0.07 ± 0.14 vs. 0.17 ± 0.22 events/patient/year, p<0.05) than children treated with MDI. In contrast, body mass index and number of severe hypoglycemic episodes did not differ between the two groups. No diabetic ketoacidosis episode was recorded in either group.
The results from this study suggest that treatment with CSII provided better metabolic control than treatment with MDI, in spite of lower daily doses of insulin and without increasing acute complications, in children with T1D.

Sensor augmented pump therapy from onset of type 1 diabetes: late follow-up results of the Pediatric Onset Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22487079/),"
To evaluate the metabolic control and β-cell function 1 yr after the end of the European multicentre randomized Pediatric Onset Study.
Of 154 study patients, 131 were re-examined 24 months after type 1 diabetes onset (49.6% boys, age at onset 8.9 ± 4.3 yrs). Of which, 62 patients belonged to the primary group of the main study applying a sensor-augmented pump system during the first yr and 69 patients to the control group performing conventional insulin pump therapy with self-monitoring blood glucose. HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, and C-peptide were centrally measured (Clinical Trail Registration Number: ISRCTN05450731).
At 24 months, i.e., 1 yr after the end of the interventional study, 52.4% of the patients used the sensor-augmented pump system, 46.0% conventional pump, and 1.6% multiple daily injections. HbA1c was 7.6 ± 1.3% in the primary and 7.7 ± 1.2% in the control group (p = 0.493). Frequent sensor use during the first yr was associated with statistically insignificant lowering of the HbA1c at 24 months (p = 0.236) as compared with irregular or no sensor use (7.4 ± 1.0% vs. 7.7 ± 1.3%). Although fasting C-peptide was not clearly different between the primary and control group (0.13 ± 0.17 vs. 0.09 ± 0.10 nmol/L, p = 0.121), patients with frequent sensor use had significantly less C-peptide loss within 24 months (C-peptide reduction 0.02 ± 0.18 vs. 0.07 ± 0.11 nmol/L, p = 0.046). There was no difference between the groups regarding daily insulin requirements.
Sensor-augmented pump therapy from onset of diabetes may lead to better long-term glycemic control and help to preserve endogenous β-cell function, if patients comply with frequent use of continuous glucose monitoring.

Guidelines for application of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) therapy in the perioperative period.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22401338/),"
Case reports indicate that diabetes patients receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy have been allowed to continue treatment during surgical procedures. Although allowed during surgery, there is actually little information in the medical literature on how to manage patients receiving insulin pump therapy during a planned surgical procedure. A multidisciplinary work group reviewed current information regarding the use of insulin pumps in the perioperative period. Although the work group identified safety issues specific to surgical scenarios, it believed that with the use of standardized guidelines and a checklist, continuation of insulin pump therapy during the perioperative period is feasible. A sample set of protocols have been developed and are summarized. A policy outlining clear procedures should be established at the institutional level to guide physicians and other staff if the devices are to be employed during the perioperative period. Additional clinical experience with the technology in surgical scenarios is needed, and consensus should be developed for insulin pump use in the perioperative phases of care.

Continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump therapy for diabetes in pregnancy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22384837/),"
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) systems, or insulin pumps, offer great promise for improved glycemic control during pregnancy. Combined, these two devices could potentially constitute an artificial pancreas, where real-time blood glucose readings are relayed to an insulin pump that uses a personalized algorithm to decide how much insulin is needed by the patient's body. However, the promise of these two systems have not yet been proven individually or in combination in controlled clinical trials to improve pregnancy outcomes. Such trials are urgently needed before the widespread use of these devices in pregnancy can be justified.

Management of diabetes mellitus: is the pump mightier than the pen?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22371161/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII, or insulin pump therapy) reduces HbA1c levels and hypoglycaemia in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) compared with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). The greatest reduction in HbA(1c) levels with CSII occurs in patients with the worst glycaemic control; therefore, the most appropriate and cost-effective use of CSII in adults with T1DM is in those who have continued, elevated HbA(1c) levels or disabling hypoglycaemic episodes with MDI (including the use of long-acting insulin analogues and structured patient education). The disadvantages of CSII include higher costs than MDI and the risk of ketosis in the event of pump failure. In children with T1DM, CSII may be used when MDI is considered impractical or inappropriate. Pumps are not generally recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus but may improve control in some subgroups. A new generation of smaller insulin infusion pumps with an integrated cannula, called patch pumps, could improve uptake of CSII in general. The important clinical question is not whether CSII is more efficacious than MDI in general adult T1DM, but whether CSII further improves glycaemic control when this control continues to be poor with MDI, and evidence exists that in most cases it does.

Patient perceptions of using the OmniPod system compared with conventional insulin pumps in young adults with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22283640/),"
This study evaluated treatment satisfaction, comfort, and function using the wireless OmniPod™ Insulin Management System (Insulet Corp., Bedford, MA) compared with conventional (infusion set) insulin pumps in young adults with type 1 diabetes.
Twenty-nine patients (age, 24.0 ± 5.1 years; diabetes duration, 12.1 ± 5.7 years; insulin pump duration, 6.4 ± 3.1 years; glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c], 8.6 ± 0.7%) participated in a randomized, two-arm open crossover study comparing two consecutive 12-week periods of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII): one period using the OmniPod system and the other period using conventional CSII. The main outcome measures were treatment satisfaction (Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire), user evaluation (OmniPod System User Evaluation Questionnaire), and HbA1c levels.
Treatment satisfaction at baseline was high, with a mean score of 28.6±4.6 (maximal score, 36) and no significant difference between the two randomized groups. Upon completion of the study period 43% ""would switch to OmniPod,"" 36% were ""undecided,"" and 21% ""would not switch pumps."" Seventy-six percent preferred the OmniPod automated cannula insertion system, and 56% reported that OmniPod fit better into their lifestyle than conventional CSII. HbA1c levels significantly decreased with both OmniPod and conventional CSII (7.9 ± 0.9% vs. 8.8 ± 0.7% and 8.2 ± 0.9% vs. 8.5 ± 0.5%, respectively; P<0.001 for both groups) after completion of the first treatment arm. The decrease in HbA1c was more marked in the OmniPod group (P=0.044), without additional improvement at the end of the study in either group.
The OmniPod system was well received by young adults with type 1 diabetes experienced with conventional CSII.

Continuous glucose monitoring systems for type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22258980/),"
Self-monitoring of blood glucose is essential to optimise glycaemic control in type 1 diabetes mellitus. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems measure interstitial fluid glucose levels to provide semi-continuous information about glucose levels, which identifies fluctuations that would not have been identified with conventional self-monitoring. Two types of CGM systems can be defined: retrospective systems and real-time systems. Real-time systems continuously provide the actual glucose concentration on a display. Currently, the use of CGM is not common practice and its reimbursement status is a point of debate in many countries.
To assess the effects of CGM systems compared to conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) in patients with diabetes mellitus type 1.
We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for the identification of studies. Last search date was June 8, 2011.
Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing retrospective or real-time CGM with conventional self-monitoring of blood glucose levels or with another type of CGM system in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Primary outcomes were glycaemic control, e.g. level of glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and health-related quality of life. Secondary outcomes were adverse events and complications, CGM derived glycaemic control, death and costs.
Two authors independently selected the studies, assessed the risk of bias and performed data-extraction. Although there was clinical and methodological heterogeneity between studies an exploratory meta-analysis was performed on those outcomes the authors felt could be pooled without losing clinical merit.
The search identified 1366 references. Twenty-two RCTs meeting the inclusion criteria of this review were identified. The results of the meta-analyses (across all age groups) indicate benefit of CGM for patients starting on CGM sensor augmented insulin pump therapy compared to patients using multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) and standard monitoring blood glucose (SMBG). After six months there was a significant larger decline in HbA1c level for real-time CGM users starting insulin pump therapy compared to patients using MDI and SMBG (mean difference (MD) in change in HbA1c level -0.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.8% to -0.5%, 2 RCTs, 562 patients, I(2)=84%). The risk of hypoglycaemia was increased for CGM users, but CIs were wide and included unity (4/43 versus 1/35; RR 3.26, 95% CI 0.38 to 27.82 and 21/247 versus 17/248; RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.67 to 2.29). One study reported the occurrence of ketoacidosis from baseline to six months; there was however only one event. Both RCTs were in patients with poorly controlled diabetes.For patients starting with CGM only, the average decline in HbA1c level six months after baseline was also statistically significantly larger for CGM users compared to SMBG users, but much smaller than for patients starting using an insulin pump and CGM at the same time (MD change in HbA1c level -0.2%, 95% CI -0.4% to -0.1%, 6 RCTs, 963 patients, I(2)=55%). On average, there was no significant difference in risk of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis between CGM and SMBG users. The confidence interval however, was wide and included a decreased as well as an increased risk for CGM users compared to the control group (severe hypoglycaemia: 36/411 versus 33/407; RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.62, 4 RCTs, I(2)=0% and ketoacidosis: 8/411 versus 8/407; RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.36 to 2.40, 4 RCTs, I(2)=0%).Health-related quality of life was reported in five of the 22 studies. In none of these studies a significant difference between CGM and SMBG was found. Diabetes complications, death and costs were not measured.There were no studies in pregnant women with diabetes type 1 and in patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness.
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in children, adults and patients with poorly controlled diabetes. The largest improvements in glycaemic control were seen for sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in patients with poorly controlled diabetes who had not used an insulin pump before. The risk of severe hypoglycaemia or ketoacidosis was not significantly increased for CGM users, but as these events occurred infrequent these results have to be interpreted cautiously.There are indications that higher compliance of wearing the CGM device improves glycosylated haemoglobin A1c level (HbA1c) to a larger extent.Â

Continuous interferon-α2b infusion in combination with ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C in treatment-experienced patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22300892/),"
Sustained virological response (SVR) rates in previous non-responders to pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN)-α and ribavirin for chronic HCV remain low (~10%). We hypothesize that continuous subcutaneous delivery of fully potent interferon (IFN)-α2b via an external pump will lead to stable blood concentrations and thereby prevent subtherapeutic trough levels associated with viral breakthrough. The aims of the study were to assess safety, tolerability and virological response in patients who were previous PEG-IFN-α/ribavirin non-responders.
We randomized 30 HCV genotype 1 (n=24) and genotype 4 (n=6) patients to receive 6, 9 or 12 million units (MU) IFN-α2b daily by continuous subcutaneous administration using an insulin pump (MiniMed(®) 508; Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) in combination with ribavirin (1,000-1,600 mg) for 48 weeks.
The magnitude of viral decline in the 12 MU group after 4 weeks of treatment was 2.67 log HCV RNA compared with 1.21 and 1.27 log HCV RNA in the 9 and 6 MU groups, respectively (P=0.001). In the intention-to-treat analysis, the SVR rate was 20% (6/30). The per-protocol SVR rate was 25% (6/24), of which four out of six patients in the high-dose arm achieved SVR. Adverse events appeared dose-dependent, were mostly mild-to-moderate and were typical of IFN therapy. Five patients developed irritation and/or abscesses at the injection site. Six serious adverse events were reported in five patients.
Continuous delivery of IFN-α2b can induce a strong dose-dependent viral suppression. This could be an effective approach in conjunction with, or as lead-in therapy prior to, treatment with a direct antiviral agent.

A review of the security of insulin pump infusion systems.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22226278/),"
Insulin therapy has enabled patients with diabetes to maintain blood glucose control to lead healthier lives. Today, rather than injecting insulin manually using syringes, a patient can use a device such as an insulin pump to deliver insulin programmatically. This allows for more granular insulin delivery while attaining blood glucose control. Insulin pump system features have increasingly benefited patients, but the complexity of the resulting system has grown in parallel. As a result, security breaches that can negatively affect patient health are now possible. Rather than focus on the security of a single device, we concentrate on protecting the security of the entire system. In this article, we describe the security issues as they pertain to an insulin pump system that includes an embedded system of components, which include the insulin pump, continuous glucose management system, blood glucose monitor, and other associated devices (e.g., a mobile phone or personal computer). We detail not only the growing wireless communication threat in each system component, but also describe additional threats to the system (e.g., availability and integrity). Our goal is to help create a trustworthy infusion pump system that will ultimately strengthen pump safety, and we describe mitigating solutions to address identified security issues.

Pancreatic polypeptide administration enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces the insulin requirement of patients on insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22226275/),"
The effects of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) infusion were examined in patients on insulin pump therapy to determine whether PP administration can reduce insulin requirements in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) or type 3c diabetes mellitus (T3cDM; pancreatogenic).
Ten subjects with long-standing T1DM (n = 7) or T3cDM (n = 3) on insulin pump treatment received a 72 h subcutaneous infusion of 2 pmol/kg/min bovine PP or saline by portable infusion pump in a single-blinded, randomized, crossover design.
Pancreatic polypeptide infusion raised plasma PP levels to 450-700 pmol/liter. Daily insulin infusion requirements (I) fell from 48 ± 6.9 to 40 ± 7.5 U on day 2 (p < .05) and from 46 ± 7.7 to 37 ± 6.6 U on day 3 (p < .05) of PP infusion compared with saline. Corrected for average blood glucose concentration (G), I/G fell in 10/10 subjects during the second 24 h period and in 7/10 subjects during the third 24 h period; sensitivity to insulin, calculated as 1/(I/G), increased 45% ± 12% on day 2 (p < .01) and 34% ± 14% on day 3 (p < .05) of PP infusion. Pancreatic polypeptide responses to a test meal were compared with the change in insulin infusion requirements in 5 subjects; the reduction in insulin requirements seen during PP infusion correlated with the degree of baseline PP deficiency (p < .002).
A concurrent subcutaneous infusion of PP enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces insulin requirements in patients with long-standing T1DM and T3cDM on insulin pump therapy. The benefit of PP infusion correlated with the degree of PP deficiency.

Novel methodology to determine the accuracy of the OmniPod insulin pump: a key component of the artificial pancreas system.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22226273/),"
This article describes two novel and easy approaches for assessing the accuracy of insulin pumps as implemented within the artificial pancreas system. The approaches are illustrated by data testing the OmniPod Insulin Management System at its lowest delivery volume (0.05 U) and at doses of 0.1, 0.2, 1, and 6U.
In method 1, a pipette, digital microscope, and imaging software were used to measure average bolus delivery on a linear scale for multiple volumes. In method 2, a digital microscope and imaging software were used to measure the volume of a spherical bolus of 0.05 U of insulin.
Bench testing results using the two novel methods demonstrated that the OmniPod is extremely accurate, with a relative error ranging from -0.90% to +0.96% for all measured doses (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 1, and 6 U). In method 1, at target bolus dose of 0.05 U, the mean delivered dose (± standard deviation) was 0.0497 ± 0.003 U, 0.099 ± 0.005 U at 0.1 U, 0.2 ± <1e-5 U at 0.2 U, 1.001 ± 0.018 U at 1 U, and 6.03 ± 0.04 U at 6 U. In method 2, at target bolus dose of 0.5 ml, the mean delivered dose for both OmniPods was 0.505 ± 0.014.
Both methods confirmed a high degree of accuracy for the OmniPod insulin pump. These techniques can be used to estimate delivery volume in other infusion pumps as well.

The ASPIRE study: design and methods of an in-clinic crossover trial on the efficacy of automatic insulin pump suspension in exercise-induced hypoglycemia.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22226267/),"
The Paradigm®Veo™ System includes a low glucose suspend (LGS) feature which suspends insulin delivery when a prespecified glucose threshold setting is reached by the associated continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. The ASPIRE (Automation to Simulate Pancreatic Insulin REsponse) study is a multicenter, in-clinic, randomized, crossover study to examine the efficacy of LGS in exercise-induced hypoglycemia.
Insulin-pump users underwent two separate exercise sessions, one with the LGS feature set to suspend insulin (LGS-on) when the CGM-detected glucose concentration was ≤ 70 mg/dl and one with the LGS feature off. Exercise sessions were conducted after an overnight fast and with initial plasma glucose level as measured by the YSI 2300 STAT Plus glucose analyzer (YSI) of 100-140 mg/dl. Subjects exercised until their YSI value fell to ≤ 85 mg/dl; subsequent YSI values <70 mg/dl were recorded for up to 4 h to measure the duration and nadir of hypoglycemia. The protocol required that subjects with YSI values <50 or >300 mg/dl were rescued with carbohydrates or insulin, respectively, based on the provider's recommendation. The primary end point was comparison of duration and severity of hypoglycemia between LGS-on and LGS-off sessions. Secondary end points included areas under the glucose concentration curve, CGM sensor accuracy, and last YSI glucose. Device- and procedure-related adverse events and serious adverse events were recorded.
Fifty adults and teenagers (17-58 years) with type 1 diabetes were randomized. Study completion is expected in November 2011.

The aim of this article is to extend our previous work on the GIIP model by articulating safety requirements that address the identified GIIP hazards. These safety requirements can be validated by manufacturers, and may ultimately serve as a safety reference for insulin pump software. Together, these two publications can serve as a basis for discussing insulin pump safety in the diabetes community.
In our previous work, we established a generic insulin pump architecture that abstracts functions common to many insulin pumps currently on the market and near-future pump designs. We then carried out a preliminary hazard analysis based on this architecture that included consultations with many domain experts. Further consultation with domain experts resulted in the safety requirements used in the modeling work presented in this article.
Generic safety requirements for the GIIP model are presented, as appropriate, in parameterized format to accommodate clinical practices or specific insulin pump criteria important to safe device performance.
We believe that there is considerable value in having the diabetes, academic, and manufacturing communities consider and discuss these generic safety requirements. We hope that the communities will extend and revise them, make them more representative and comprehensive, experiment with them, and use them as a means for assessing the safety of insulin pump software designs. One potential use of these requirements is to integrate them into model-based engineering (MBE) software development methods. We believe, based on our experiences, that implementing safety requirements using MBE methods holds promise in reducing design/implementation flaws in insulin pump development and evolutionary processes, therefore improving overall safety of insulin pump software.

Insulin pump therapy is equally effective and safe in elderly and young type 1 diabetes patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22189548/),"
It is generally accepted that in adult type 1 diabetes patients (T1D) continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via a personal pump is more effective than the multiple daily injections (MDI) model. However, it is not clear whether all age groups of adult T1D patients may equally benefit from CSII therapy. We aimed to compare the glycemic control and use of selected pump tools in T1D subjects using CSII over the age of 50 (50+ T1D) with patients younger than 50 years of age.
The last available insulin pump/blood glucose meter downloads and last available HbA1c levels of 124 adult T1D subjects using CSII were reviewed. We divided our cohort into two subgroups: 50+ T1D patients (n = 13) and younger patients (n = 111).
There were no differences in glycemic control achieved with CSII treatment in 50+ T1D patients vs. younger subjects. HbA1c levels were 7.01 ± 0.67% and 7.34 ± 1.24% (p = 0.46), and the mean glycemia based on glucometer downloads was 141.8 ± 17.7 mg/dl and 150.8 ± 35.7 mg/dl (p = 0.69), respectively. Also, there were no differences with respect to the use of important personal pump options and tools.
In conclusion, insulin pump therapy appears to be effective and safe in T1D patients regardless of age.

"Relapsing insulin-induced lipoatrophy, cured by prolonged low-dose oral prednisone: a case report.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22145998/),"
Circumscript, progressing lipoatrophy at the insulin injection sites is an unexplained, however rare condition in diabetes mellitus.
We report a case of severe localised lipoatrophy developing during insulin pump-treatment (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) with the insulin analogue lispro (Humalog®) in a woman with type-1 diabetes mellitus. After 11 months of progressing lipoatrophy at two spots on the abdomen, low-dose prednisone (5-10 mg) p.o. was given at breakfast for 8 months, whereby the atrophic lesions centripetally re-filled with subcutaneous fat tissue (confirmed by MRI) despite ongoing use of insulin lispro. However, 4 weeks after cessation of prednisone, lipoatrophy relapsed, but resolved after another 2 months of low-dose prednisone. No further relapse was noted during 12 months of follow-up on insulin-pump therapy with Humalog®.
Consistent with an assumed inflammatory nature of the condition, low-dose oral prednisone appeared to have cured the lipoatrophic reaction in our patient. Our observation suggests a temporary intolerance of the subcutaneous fat tissue to insulin lispro (Humalog®), triggered by an unknown endogenous mechanism.

Beneficial effect of real-time continuous glucose monitoring system on glycemic control in type 1 diabetic patients: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22096111/),"
Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) provides detailed information on glucose patterns and trends, thus allowing the patients to manage their diabetes more effectively.
The aim of this study was to explore the potential beneficial effects of the use of RT-CGM on diabetes management compared with self blood glucose measurement (SBGM) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), by means of a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched through by two independent investigators for RCTs concerning the use of RT-CGM in patients with T1DM. Only studies with a similar insulin regimen in the experimental and control groups were included in the analysis.
Seven RCTs (n=948) met the inclusion criteria. Combined data from all studies showed better HbA1c reduction in subjects using RT-CGM compared with those using SBGM (mean difference (MD) -0.25; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): from -0.34 to -0.17; P<0.001). Patients treated with insulin pump and RT-CGM had a lower HbA1c level compared with subjects managed with insulin pump and SBGM (four RCTs, n=497; MD -0.26; 95% CI: from -0.43 to -0.10; P=0.002). The benefits of applying RT-CGM were not associated with an increasing rate of major hypoglycemic episodes. The use of RT-CGM for over 60-70% of time was associated with a significant lowering of HbA1c.
RT-CGM is more beneficial than SBGM in reducing HbA1c in patients with type 1 diabetes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of this system in the pediatric population, especially in very young children.

Synthetic human parathyroid hormone 1-34 replacement therapy: a randomized crossover trial comparing pump versus injections in the treatment of chronic hypoparathyroidism.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22090268/),"
Vitamin D therapy for hypoparathyroidism does not restore PTH-dependent renal calcium reabsorption, which can lead to renal damage. An alternative approach, PTH 1-34 administered twice daily, provides acceptable long-term treatment but is associated with nonphysiological serum calcium fluctuation.
Our objective was to compare continuous PTH 1-34 delivery, by insulin pump, with twice-daily delivery.
In a 6-month, open-label, randomized, crossover trial, PTH 1-34 was delivered by pump or twice-daily sc injection. After each 3-month study period, serum and 24-h urine mineral levels and bone turnover markers were measured daily for 3 d, and 24-h biochemical profiles were determined for serum minerals and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and for urine minerals and cAMP. STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Eight patients with postsurgical hypoparathyroidism (mean ± sd age 46 ± 5.6 yr) participated at a tertiary care referral center.
Pump vs. twice-daily delivery of PTH 1-34 produced less fluctuation in serum calcium, a more than 50% reduction in urine calcium (P = 0.002), and a 65% reduction in the PTH dose to maintain eucalcemia (P < 0.001). Pump delivery also produced higher serum magnesium level (P = 0.02), normal urine magnesium, and reduced need for magnesium supplements. Finally, pump delivery normalized bone turnover markers and significantly lowered urinary cross-linked N-telopeptide of type 1 collagen and pyridinium crosslinks compared with twice-daily injections (P < 0.05).
Pump delivery of PTH 1-34 provides the closest approach to date to physiological replacement therapy for hypoparathyroidism.

Impact of insulin pumps on glycaemic control in a pump-naïve paediatric regional population.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22085335/),"
To examine the clinical impact of insulin-pump therapy for children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in a regional paediatric service, Auckland, New Zealand.
Retrospective analysis of children with T1DM from the Starship paediatric diabetes database who started on insulin-pump therapy from 2002 to 2008 compared with the whole T1DM population and with an equal number of non-pump patients matched by age, sex, ethnicity and duration of diabetes.
From 621 subjects with 6680 clinic visits, 75 children were treated with insulin-pump therapy for more than 12 months. Transitioning to insulin-pump treatment was associated with an improvement in HbA1c compared with baseline (-0.3%/year, P < 0.001) for up to 3 years. In contrast, despite similar deprivation scores, non-pump controls showed a continuing trend to higher HbA1C values (+0.2%/year, P < 0.01). The risk of severe hypoglycaemia fell after pump start (from 27 (0-223) to 5 (0-0.91) events/100 patient years) with no change in non-pump controls; the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis remained low in both groups.
In a pump-naïve regional paediatric population, insulin-pump therapy for T1DM was safe and effective, and associated with sustained improvements in HbA1c and lower risk of hypoglycaemia.

Usage and effectiveness of the low glucose suspend feature of the Medtronic Paradigm Veo insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22027306/),"
Sensor-augmented insulin pumps may be programmed to suspend insulin delivery in response to hypoglycemia. The Medtronic Paradigm® Veo™ pump with automatic low glucose suspend (LGS) was released in 2009. Data from 7 months of real-world use of the system were analyzed to assess usage patterns and effectiveness of LGS.
Data from 935 patients totaling 49,867 patient days were collected; the LGS feature was on for 82% of these days. A subset of 278 subjects who used the pump for ≥3 months was analyzed separately; these subjects provided 28,401 patient days of data, with LGS used for 92% of the time.
The LGS threshold was most commonly set between 50 and 60 mg/dl. A total of 27,216 LGS events occurred, and 60% began in the afternoon or evening. The median duration of LGS events was 9.87 min, 45% lasted for <5 min, and 11% lasted for >115 min (equivalent to the full extent of the LGS event between 115 and 120 min). Among the episodes lasting for >115 min, the mean sensor glucose (SG) was 58.8 ± 12.4 mg/dl at LGS activation (time 0), rose to 102.2 ± 52.8 mg/dl by the end of the LGS episode (when insulin delivery was automatically resumed), and was 150.1 ± 68.6 mg/dl at 240 min. In the 278-subject subgroup, LGS usage significantly reduced the number of SG readings <50 mg/dl (p = 0.001) and >300 mg/dl (p = 0.001).
The LGS feature was on for most of the patient days in the study. Most LGS episodes lasted for <10 min. Use of the LGS feature significantly reduced exposure to hypoglycemia. Profound hyperglycemia resulting from LGS episodes lasting >115 min was not observed.

"Effects of everyday life events on glucose, insulin, and glucagon dynamics in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion-treated type 1 diabetes: collection of clinical data for glucose modeling.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22023376/),"
In the development of glucose control algorithms, mathematical models of glucose metabolism are useful for conducting simulation studies and making real-time predictions upon which control calculations can be based. To obtain type 1 diabetes (T1D) data for the modeling of glucose metabolism, we designed and conducted a clinical study.
Patients with insulin pump-treated T1D were recruited to perform everyday life events on two separate days. During the study, patients wore their insulin pumps and, in addition, a continuous glucose monitor and an activity monitor to estimate energy expenditure. The sequence of everyday life events was predetermined and included carbohydrate intake, insulin boluses, and bouts of exercise; the events were introduced, temporally separated, in different orders and in different quantities. Throughout the study day, 10-min plasma glucose measurements were taken, and samples for plasma insulin and glucagon analyses were obtained every 10 min for the first 30 min after an event and subsequently every 30 min.
We included 12 patients with T1D (75% female, 34.3±9.1 years old [mean±SD], hemoglobin A1c 6.7±0.4%). During the 24 study days we collected information-rich, high-quality data during fast and slow changes in plasma glucose following carbohydrate intake, exercise, and insulin boluses.
This study has generated T1D data suitable for glucose modeling, which will be used in the development of glucose control strategies. Furthermore, the study has given new physiologic insight into the metabolic effects of carbohydrate intake, insulin boluses, and exercise in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion-treated patients with T1D.

"A 16-week open-label, multicenter pilot study assessing insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes suboptimally controlled with multiple daily injections.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880230/),"
We assessed the efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who were suboptimally controlled with a multiple daily injection (MDI) regimen.
In this subanalysis of a 16-week multicenter study, 21 insulin-pump-naïve patients [age 57 ± 13 years, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) 8.4 ± 1.0%, body weight 98 ± 20 kg, total daily insulin dose 99 ± 65 U, mean ± standard deviation] treated at baseline with MDI therapy with or without oral antidiabetic agents discontinued all diabetes medications except metformin and initiated insulin pump therapy. Insulin was titrated to achieve the best possible glycemic control with the simplest possible dosing regimen. Outcome measures included A1C, fasting and postprandial glucose, body weight, incidence of hypoglycemia, and PROs.
Glycemic control improved significantly after 16 weeks: A1C 7.3 ± 1.0% (-1.1 ± 1.2%, p < .001), fasting glucose 133 ± 33 mg/dl (-32 ± 74 mg/dl, p < .005), and postprandial glucose 153 ± 35 mg/dl (-38 ± 46 mg/dl, p < .001). At week 16, the mean daily basal, bolus, and total insulin doses were 66 ± 36, 56 ± 40, and 122 ± 72 U (1.2 U/kg), respectively, and 90% of patients were treated with two or fewer daily basal rates. Body weight increased by 2.8 ± 2.6 kg (p < .001). Mild hypoglycemia was experienced by 81% of patients at least once during the course of the study with no episodes of severe hypoglycemia. There were significant improvements in PRO measures.
Insulin pump therapy using a relatively simple dosing regimen safely improved glucose control and PROs in patients with T2DM who were unable to achieve glycemic targets with MDI therapy. Controlled trials are needed to further assess the clinical benefits and cost-effectiveness of insulin pumps in this patient population.

Analysis of the environmental impact of insulin infusion sets based on loss of resources with waste.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21880223/),"
Insulin pump therapy [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] requires regular change of infusion sets every 2-3 days in order to minimize the risk of skin irritations or other adverse events. This has been discussed to be a potential burden to the environment. The purpose of this analysis was to perform an environmental assessment of insulin pump infusion sets based on loss of resources occurring during incineration of the discarded products and by means of a lifecycle concept used to weight a material in relation to its rareness on earth and its consumption. In addition to five infusion sets (Inset30, InsetII, Comfort, Quick-set, and Cleo), a patch pump (Omnipod) was also included in this analysis. The annual loss in waste of the so called ""person reserve"" of 3 days of catheter use was compared with daily consumption of a cup of coffee in a disposable paper cup and to a soft drink in an aluminum can. The weight-based loss in resources through waste for the infusion sets (except for Cleo) corresponded to 70-200% of the loss of resources for a coffee cup (Cleo, 320%; Omnipod, 1,821,600%) and to 1-3% of the loss from an aluminum soft drink can (Cleo, 5%; Omnipod, 31,200%). The loss or resources by use of infusion sets used in insulin pump therapy appears to be low and is similar to the burden induced by the uptake of one cup of coffee per day. The loss or resources with regular CSII is considerably lower than the loss or resources induced by patch pumps.

Changes in altitude cause unintended insulin delivery from insulin pumps: mechanisms and implications.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21816978/),"
Children and adults with type 1 diabetes who receive insulin pump therapy have reported hypoglycemia during air travel. We studied the effects of atmospheric pressure on insulin pump delivery.
Ten insulin pumps were connected to capillary tubes. The effects of changes in ambient pressure on insulin delivery, bubble formation, bubble size, and cartridge plunger movement were analyzed.
During a flight (200 mmHg pressure decrease), excess insulin delivery of 0.623% of the cartridge volume occurred (P < 0.001, Student t test). In hypobaric chamber studies, bubbles developed in the insulin when the pressure decreased and displaced the insulin out of the cartridge. Pre-existing bubbles changed in size consistent with Boyle law. Cartridge plunger movement did not occur in normal flight conditions but did occur when catastrophic plane depressurization was mimicked.
Atmospheric pressure reduction causes predictable, unintended insulin delivery in pumps by bubble formation and expansion of existing bubbles.

Is there a difference in pregnancy and glycemic outcome in patients with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump with constant or intermittent glucose monitoring? A pilot study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21751889/),"
The aim of the study is to describe glycemic and insulin outcomes by trimester and maternal and fetal outcome in patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump with constant or intermittent continuous glucose monitoring (CGM).
Twenty-five women with type 1 diabetes with newly diagnosed pregnancy were treated with insulin pump therapy (Medtronic 722, Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA) for at least 1 year. Insulin pump and CGM (Medtronic Paradigm Real-Time) were implemented at least 3 months before conception. Patients were randomized in two groups: constant CGM group, 12 patients on insulin pump with glucose sensor, 24 h/day; and intermittent CGM group, 13 patients on insulin pump with intermittent glucose sensor, 14 days/month. The following parameters were analyzed: glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), mean blood glucose, insulin requirement (in IU/kg/day), weight gain, severe hypoglycemic events, diabetic ketoacidosis, macrosomia, cesarean section, and neonatal hypoglycemia.
Both groups achieved good glucose control during their pregnancies (P<0.05): 6.78±1.3% and 6.92±0.9% at the beginning of the study compared with 6.14±0.9% (constant CGM group) and 6.23±0.6% (intermittent CGM group) at the end of the study (last HbA1c before delivery). There was no significant decrease of HbA1c between the two groups. The constant CGM group had a significantly lower A1c in the first trimester compared with the intermittent CGM group. Maternal and fetal outcome did not show a significant difference between the two groups.
Insulin pump therapy together with constant or intermittent CGM can improve diabetes control and pregnancy outcome in type 1 diabetes. The quality of the glucose profile at conception was the important factor for pregnancy outcome.

"Experiences of children/young people and their parents, using insulin pump therapy for the management of type 1 diabetes: qualitative review.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21729118/),"
Advances in medical technology have made insulin pumps an attractive treatment option for patients with type 1 diabetes and in particular for children and young people. Previous studies have accounted the experiences and views of children/young people and their parents for the use of the injection therapy, but very few have focused on the use of insulin pumps. The objective of this review was to identify studies that explore the experiences of children/young people and their parents on the transition from injections to insulin pump therapy, in the context of their social life.
A systematic literature search was conducted, and six studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified.
  Views and perspectives from the studies identified mainly focused on: introduction to the pump; reasons for the transition to pump therapy; advantages and disadvantages of this treatment option; and impact on quality of life (QoL). Parents and/or children reported that they learned about pump therapy either formally from a healthcare professional or informally from a friend or the internet. Many reasons were identified for the transition, the most important being the pursuit of stable and controlled blood sugar levels and the desire for a more flexible lifestyle. Participants highlighted the advantages of insulin pumps in terms of improved diabetes control. Moreover, there was a positive impact on the QoL, as insulin pumps provided children greater flexibility in lifestyles especially with regards to meals and socialization. In contrast, psychosocial issues such as pump visibility and physical restrictions were highlighted as disadvantages. Issues such as day-to-day management were also discussed.
Exploring children/young people's perspectives on the use of pump therapy for managing their diabetes, and parental reflections in caring for those children is important as it provides evidence informing policy for the wider implementation of this technology in the management of diabetes in children. However, the review revealed that there is a scarcity of data in this area and that further research is needed.

Insulin pump therapy started at the time of diagnosis: effects on glycemic control and pancreatic β-cell function in type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21718094/),"
In the interest of preserving residual insulin secretory capacity present at the time of diagnosis with type 1 diabetes (T1D), we compared the efficacy of starting insulin pump therapy at diagnosis with standard multiple daily insulin injections (MDIs).
We conducted a prospective, randomized, pilot trial comparing MDI therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy (pump therapy) in 24 patients, 8-18 years old, with newly diagnosed T1D. Subjects were evaluated at enrollment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1D. Preservation of insulin secretion, measured by mixed-meal-stimulated C-peptide secretion, was compared after 6 and 12 months of treatment. Between-group differences in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), continuous glucose sensor data, insulin utilization, anthropometric measures, and patient satisfaction with therapy were also compared at multiple time points.
Initiation of pump therapy within 1 month of diagnosis resulted in consistently higher mixed-meal tolerance test-stimulated C-peptide values at all time points, although these differences were not statistically significant. Nonetheless, improved glycemic control was observed in insulin pump-treated subjects (more time spent with normoglycemia, better mean HbA1c), and pump-treated subjects reported comparatively greater satisfaction with route of treatment administration.
Initiation of insulin pump therapy at diagnosis improved glycemic control, was well tolerated, and contributed to improved patient satisfaction with treatment. This study also suggests that earlier use of pump therapy might help to preserve residual β-cell function, although a larger clinical trial would be required to confirm this.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in inpatient setting: unmet needs and the proposal of a CSII unit.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21714675/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) represents an increasingly popular method of treating diabetes. Patients with diabetes are often hospitalized, and current data indicate that inpatient hyperglycemia results in poorer outcomes. When patients on insulin pump therapy require hospitalization, practitioners caring for them face the issue of how to manage the inpatient care of these patients. We believe that patients using insulin pumps can safely have their therapy transitioned when hospitalized. Moreover, CSII during hospitalization should be regarded not only as a fundamental tool in patients already on insulin pump therapy, but also as an effective method to obtain euglycemia, in critically ill patients. However, a standard policy on CSII use during hospitalization is still lacking, and literature data are inconclusive about the benefits of insulin pump on glycemic homeostasis, in hospitalized patients. We suggest that a CSII unit should be activated inside the hospital, in order to increase compliance with required procedures and to properly address the unmet needs of CSII in inpatient setting.

Treatment of congenital hyperinsulinism with lanreotide acetate (Somatuline Autogel).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21697252/),"
Congenital hyperinsulinism (CH) may be treated conservatively in many children with octreotide given by multiple sc injections or via an insulin pump.
We describe two children treated with a once-monthly injection of a long-acting somatostatin analog.
Both patients presented with hypoglycemia 30 min after birth and were subsequently diagnosed with CH. Patients were initially treated with diazoxide, hydrochlorothiazide, frequent feedings, and octreotide via an insulin pump. With this therapy, they were normoglycemic with a good growth rate, normal weight gain, and excellent neurodevelopment. Treatment with the long-acting somatostatin analog lanreotide acetate (Somatuline Autogel), administered by deep sc injection of 30 mg once a month, was started at the ages of 4Â½ and 4 yr, respectively. Octreotide infusion was gradually weaned over 1 month. Continuous glucose monitoring after discontinuation of pump therapy showed normoglycemia. The first patient has now been treated with the lanreotide acetate for over 5 yr, and the second for 3 yr. Treatment is well-tolerated, and both the patients and their parents are satisfied with the transition from pump therapy to once-a-month injection and prefer it to pump therapy.
Lanreotide acetate may be a safe and effective alternative to octreotide pump therapy in patients with CH, offering an improved quality of life. Longer follow-up of a larger patient group is needed.

An Asian Indian woman with Wolfram syndrome on insulin pump: successful pregnancy and beyond.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21517693/),"
Wolfram syndrome (WS), or DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness), is a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder with a median life expectancy of 30 years and occurs in one in 770,000 live births. To date only five successful pregnancies have been reported among WS subjects worldwide. Here we describe the sixth report of successful pregnancy in a WS patient and the first from India. The subject is still on an insulin pump, now 31 years old and doing well. She developed diabetes at 5 years of age, optic atrophy at 14 years, and diabetes insipidus at 25 years and had a successful delivery in 2007 while on an insulin pump. Sequencing of exonic regions of the WFS1 gene showed five changes, two of which were pathogenic (exon 8). Magnetic resonance imaging of brain showed generalized neurodegenerative changes. The benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and that of tight metabolic control in prevention of abortions and fetal malformations in diabetes associated with pregnancy are well documented. The impression of probable pleiotropic action of insulin pumps over and above that of glycemic reduction is gaining momentum. Recent evidence supports use of insulin pumps in alleviating neuropathic pain in diabetes, probably by virtue of its action in minimizing mean amplitude of glycemic excursions not possible with conventional insulin shots. WS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, which will probably help us in understanding the positive impact of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in prolonging the life span and retarding neuronal damage in WS.

Overnight closed loop insulin delivery (artificial pancreas) in adults with type 1 diabetes: crossover randomised controlled studies.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21493665/),"
To compare the safety and efficacy of overnight closed loop delivery of insulin (artificial pancreas) with conventional insulin pump therapy in adults with type 1 diabetes.
Two sequential, open label, randomised controlled crossover, single centre studies.
Clinical research facility.
24 adults (10 men, 14 women) with type 1 diabetes, aged 18-65, who had used insulin pump therapy for at least three months: 12 were tested after consuming a medium sized meal and the other 12 after consuming a larger meal accompanied by alcohol.
During overnight closed loop delivery, sensor measurements of glucose were fed into a computer algorithm, which advised on insulin pump infusion rates at 15 minute intervals. During control nights, conventional insulin pump settings were applied. One study compared closed loop delivery of insulin with conventional pump therapy after a medium sized evening meal (60 g of carbohydrates) at 1900, depicting the scenario of ""eating in."" The other study was carried out after a later large evening meal (100 g of carbohydrates) at 2030, accompanied by white wine (0.75 g/kg ethanol) and depicted the scenario of ""eating out.""
The primary outcome was the time plasma glucose levels were in target (3.91-8.0 mmol/L) during closed loop delivery and a comparable control period. Secondary outcomes included pooled data analysis and time plasma glucose levels were below target (≤ 3.9 mmol/L).
For the eating in scenario, overnight closed loop delivery of insulin increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 15% (interquartile range 3-35%), P = 0.002. For the eating out scenario, closed loop delivery increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 28% (2-39%), P = 0.01. Analysis of pooled data showed that the overall time plasma glucose was in target increased by a median 22% (3-37%) with closed loop delivery (P < 0.001). Closed loop delivery reduced overnight time spent hypoglycaemic (plasma glucose ≤ 3.9 mmol/L) by a median 3% (0-20%), P=0.04, and eliminated plasma glucose concentrations below 3.0 mmol/L after midnight.
These two small crossover trials suggest that closed loop delivery of insulin may improve overnight control of glucose levels and reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in adults with type 1 diabetes. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00910767 and NCT00944619.

We applied a three-level random effects model using quadratic B-spline functions to analyze inter-patient and within-patient inter-day variations of the glucose trend. The estimated SD values of the glucose curves are time-dependent and were averaged over a 24-h period. We analyzed CGM data from 322 patients with type 1 diabetes, 223 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 86 subjects without diabetes using interstitial glucose levels measured every 5 min, for approximately 8 days per patient. We compared group-wide glucose profiles from the insulin pump-treated (n = 124) and multiple daily injection (MDI)-treated (n = 144) patients with type 1 diabetes.
The average inter-patient SD values were 49 mg/dL, 43 mg/dL, and 15 mg/dL for type 1 diabetes patients, type 2 diabetes patients, and subjects without diabetes, respectively. The average within-patient, inter-day SD values were 67 mg/dL, 41 mg/dL, and 18 mg/dL, respectively. The residual SD values were 19 mg/dL, 14 mg/dL, and 8 mg/dL, respectively. We identified a statistically significant difference in glucose profiles during the morning between insulin pump-treated and MDI-treated type 1 diabetes patients.
B-spline models facilitate the analysis of CGM data and show that type 1 diabetes is associated with higher inter-day glucose variation than type 2 diabetes or being without diabetes. Pump therapy and MDI have different effects on glucose control during specific time periods.

A recent survey confirms the efficacy and the safety of implanted insulin pumps during long-term use in poorly controlled type 1 diabetes patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21470000/),"
This article reports a prolonged trial with insulin pumps implanted in patients with type 1 diabetes showing poor glucose control and a high rate of complications.
We reviewed data from 181 patients undergoing implanted insulin pump therapy. Analysis included hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, body weight, and diabetes complications status.
At implantation, the mean age was 43 (range, 19-72) years, mean duration of diabetes was 22.2 (2-52) years, and mean body weight was 68.6 (43-104) kg. The complication status involved retinopathy (62% of patients), neuropathy (34.6%), nephropathy (26%), and cardiovascular disease (14%). Patients' previous insulin treatment regimen was multiple daily injections (17.1%) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (82.9%). HbA1c levels significantly dropped from 7.9 ± 1.2% to 7.6 ± 1.2% after 1 year (P < 0.01) and remained within the range of 7.5-7.6% for up to 5 years. No significant variation of body weight or complications status occurred.
Implanted insulin pump therapy demonstrates long-term benefits in type 1 diabetes patients who have poor prognosis under intensive subcutaneous treatment.

To investigate the basal insulin requirement in total daily insulin dose in Japanese type 1 diabetic patients who use the insulin pump.
The basal insulin requirement in 35 type 1 diabetic patients without detectable C-peptide using the insulin pump (Paradigm 712) was investigated during 2-3 weeks of hospitalization. The patients were served diabetic diets of 25-30 kcal/kg ideal body weight. Each meal omission was done to confirm stable blood glucose levels within 30 mg/dL variance until the next meal. Target blood glucose level was set at 100 mg/dL before each meal and 150 mg/dL at 2 h after each meal.
Total daily insulin dose was 31.6 ± 8.5 units, and total basal insulin requirement was 8.7 ± 2.9 units, which was 27.7 ± 6.9% of the total daily dose.

[First contact with an insulin pump. Clinical case].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21414827/),"
Insulin pumps are devices that inject insulin continuously into the body in a similar way to the pancreatic secretion, and with endless possibilities to adjust schedules, meals and physical activities, giving diabetics the chance to lead a life with many less restraints due to their illness. Besides giving them this freedom, the therapy allows more precise control of blood glucose, significantly improving the overall self-control and thus the quality of life of the diabetics, reducing the appearance of long-term complications. Although all diabetics receive many guidelines and recommendations for optimal control throughout their illness patients included in this protocol must be especially aware and involved in self-control, since the treatment demands more involvement both when learning to use the device as well as making decisions once they are using it. We present the case of a type 1 diabetic patient, twenty-one years of onset, who while admitted to hospital for a day, had a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump implanted (insulin pump). To this end, we developed a patient care plan of patient following the steps of scientific method and relying on the NANDA taxonomy and on the NOC and NIC to design goals and nursing interventions, respectively.

Clarifying responsibility for self-management of diabetes in adolescents using insulin pumps--a qualitative study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21323979/),"
To gain insight into and generate theoretical knowledge about the processes involved when insulin pump-treated adolescents take or miss taking their bolus doses.
Insulin pump treatment is considered the most physiological way to imitate the healthy body's insulin profile in adolescents with diabetes. Despite insulin pump treatment, it is hard to maintain near-normal glucose control in adolescents; one reason for this is missed bolus doses with meals.
In this qualitative interview study, the grounded theory method was chosen as a model for the collection and analysis of data. Twelve adolescents (five boys and seven girls, mean age: 14·4 years, range: 12-19 years) from different Swedish paediatric diabetes clinics, four parents and one paediatric diabetes nurse were interviewed during 2008 and 2009. Two adolescents and two parents were re-interviewed after approximately 10 months. Data from clinical visits and diabetes camps were used to verify emerging categories.
Responsibility in the context of taking or missing bolus doses emerged as the core category. It is elaborated and explained through three subcategories: distribution of responsibility, transfer of responsibility and clarification of responsibility. The findings describe the need to clarify the responsibility for diabetes self-management in continuous negotiations between adolescents and parents to avoid missed doses.
Negotiations to clarify the responsibility for diabetes self-management must be a continuous process between adolescents and parents. Diabetes care teams can facilitate and encourage these negotiations.

Key elements for successful intensive insulin pump therapy in individuals with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21292340/),"
Clinical trials have demonstrated that in individuals with type 1 diabetes the use of CSII pump resulted in better glucose control. Advantages of pumps therapy include many features such as the bolus calculators (wizard). These features are optional and therefore it is important to determine whether their use is associated with better glucose control. Thus, the aim of this analysis was to assess which features and parameters of insulin pump use are associated with better glucose control.
Data regarding consecutive patients with type 1 diabetes treated with an insulin pump and attending a tertiary referral for intensive glucose control was included in this analysis. The relationship between glycemic indices and treatment parameters (number of insulin units, number of glucose readings, bolus calculator use etc.) was assessed.
A statistically significant relationship was found between glycemic indices and wizard use. Thus, individuals that used the wizard function in 50% of their boluses had an A1C, mean blood glucose values that were 0.6% (p=0.008) and 25mg/dL (p=0.000) lower respectively.
The use of the bolus calculator feature was associated with better glucose control. Larger prospective clinical trials are needed in order to further validate this finding.

Access of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes to insulin pump therapy has greatly increased in France since 2001.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21147014/),"
Insulin pump therapy is an emerging option in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D), but it often remains unused. For this reason, in 2007, a French national survey was carried out to update the frequency of insulin pump use in the paediatric population compared with a previous survey done in 2001.
The present survey was performed in hospital departments involved in paediatric diabetes management (n = 67) and in adult departments involved in adolescent diabetes management (n = 113). The number of T1D children (age < 18 years) treated in each department, with or without the use of an insulin pump, and the number of insulin pump therapies initiated during the previous year were collected.
A total of 60 paediatric and 28 adult centres responded, involving 9073 T1D children and adolescents (93% in paediatric departments). Of these patients, 1461 (16%) were treated by insulin pump, 89% of which were managed in paediatric centres. However, pump use was more frequent in adult than in paediatric centres (32% versus 18%, respectively). Also, 38% of insulin pumps were initiated during the year prior to the survey. In addition, in 2001, 140 children were treated with insulin pump in 13 paediatric centres (versus 56 centres in 2007).
The number of centres using insulin pump therapy for diabetic children and the number of children treated by insulin pump were increased fourfold and 10-fold, respectively, from 2001 to 2007, indicating greater access to pump therapy in the French paediatric population. The present survey is still ongoing to evaluate the decision-making criteria that influence the initiation of insulin pump therapy in T1D paediatric patients.

Evaluating the automated blood glucose pattern detection and case-retrieval modules of the 4 Diabetes Support System.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21129354/),"
We have developed a prototypical case-based reasoning system to enhance management of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The system is capable of automatically analyzing large volumes of life events, self-monitoring of blood glucose readings, continuous glucose monitoring system results, and insulin pump data to detect clinical problems. In a preliminary study, manual entry of large volumes of life-event and other data was too burdensome for patients. In this study, life-event and pump data collection were automated, and then the system was reevaluated.
Twenty-three adult T1DM patients on insulin pumps completed the five-week study. A usual daily schedule was entered into the database, and patients were only required to upload their insulin pump data to Medtronic's CareLink® Web site weekly. Situation assessment routines were run weekly for each participant to detect possible problems, and once the trial was completed, the case-retrieval module was tested.
Using the situation assessment routines previously developed, the system found 295 possible problems. The enhanced system detected only 2.6 problems per patient per week compared to 4.9 problems per patient per week in the preliminary study (p=.017). Problems detected by the system were correctly identified in 97.9% of the cases, and 96.1% of these were clinically useful.
With less life-event data, the system is unable to detect certain clinical problems and detects fewer problems overall. Additional work is needed to provide device/software interfaces that allow patients to provide this data quickly and conveniently.

"Multicenter user evaluation of ACCU-CHEK® Combo, an integrated system for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21129336/),"
The aim of this study was to evaluate a newly developed system for insulin delivery incorporating a multifunctional blood glucose meter and a remotely controlled insulin pump (ACCU-CHEK® Combo system) in established pump users with type 1 diabetes. The technology was assessed both from device performance and subject usability perspectives.
A multicenter, prospective, single group study was carried out in five centers in the Netherlands and four centers in the United Kingdom for more than 6 months. The study was divided into two phases: Phase 1 (4 weeks) for device validation purposes and phase 2 (22 weeks) to observe the impact of the system on metabolic control, patient satisfaction [using the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)] and device safety.
Eighty subjects completed the planned study period. There were no unexpected device errors. Treatment satisfaction was high at baseline and further increased to study end (DTSQ change version: sum score, 10.6±7.2; scale score range, -18 to +18, p<0.0001). Hemoglobin A1c improved continuously over time, from 7.9% (±0.9%) to 7.7% (±0.8%) at month 3 (p<0.001) and 7.6% (±0.8%) at month 6 (p<0.0001). The frequency of severe hypoglycemia was 0.08 per patient years. There was no case of ketoacidosis.
The new system was evaluated by experienced continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion users as safe in daily practice and associated with favorable treatment satisfaction and a modest improvement in glycemic control.

The need for delivery of small doses of insulin, together with unpredictable feeding patterns and frequent changes in nutrient intake, makes the management of neonatal diabetes challenging. The availability of continuous glucose monitoring systems in combination with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps provides an opportunity to monitor glucose levels more closely and deliver insulin more safely. We report on a preterm infant with neonatal diabetes who had profound hypoglycaemia in response to bolus subcutaneous insulin therapy, but in whom we used the combination of continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump therapy to manage glucose control in the neonatal period, and who was discharged home on pump therapy.

Guidelines for insulin dosing in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using new formulas from a retrospective study of individuals with optimal glucose levels.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20920437/),"
Successful insulin pump therapy depends on correct insulin doses based on an optimal total daily dose (TDD) and optimal pump settings for basal infusion, carbohydrate factor (CarbF), and glucose correction factor (CorrF) based on the TDD. There are limited data in the literature to guide providers and patients regarding methods to optimize these critical parameters for glucose control.
Anonymous data downloads from 1020 insulin pumps used throughout the United States and overseen by a variety of clinicians were analyzed retrospectively to find insulin doses that provided the best glucose control. A subset of 396 pumps was chosen for glucose data reliability, with over 85% of their glucose data directly entered from a meter. This subset was divided into tertiles based on glucose levels, and the low glucose tertile was analyzed to derive formulas for optimal insulin pump settings.
An inconsistent clustering of pump settings was found for the CarbF and the CorrF. This was less pronounced when CarbFs and CorrFs were determined from the actual bolus doses delivered once adjustments were made to the initial dose calculations by users and, to a larger extent, internally by the bolus calculator itself. Common beliefs that hyperglycemia is related to less carb counting, fewer carb boluses, or delivery of less insulin per day were not substantiated in this data. New or verified insulin dosing formulas presented include basal U/day = TDD × 0.48; CarbF = [2.6 × Wt(lb)]/TDD; and CorrF = 1960/TDD.
Insulin pump users cannot reap full benefit from their pump bolus calculator if the settings on which bolus doses are based are less than optimal. Our data show that CarbFs and CorrFs tend to be unevenly distributed, suggesting that these factors are not selected in a systematic manner through use of formulas. Poor glucose outcomes among insulin pump users appear to be related to pump setting errors and being relatively underinsulinized, even though those in poor control use more total insulin per day. We have developed a model with the hypothesis that improved glucose outcomes will result from the use of formulas to derive appropriate pump settings. Prospective validation of these concepts is needed.

"Hypoglycemia prevention via pump attenuation and red-yellow-green ""traffic"" lights using continuous glucose monitoring and insulin pump data.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20920434/),"
Hypoglycemia has been identified as a primary barrier to optimal management of diabetes. This observation, in conjunction with the introduction of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices, has set the stage for achieving tight glycemic control with systems that adjust the insulin pump settings based on measured glucose concentrations. Because system safety and system reliability are key considerations, there is a need for algorithms that reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in closed-loop, open-loop, and advisory-mode systems. More specifically, the algorithm presented here is formulated as a component of the independent safety system module proposed in the modular control-to-range architecture.
We developed two algorithms for attenuating insulin pump injections, which we refer to as Brakes and Power Brakes: Brakes is a pump attenuation function computed using CGM information only, while Power Brakes is an attenuation function in which a metabolic state observer with insulin input is used in addition to CGM information to inform the level of pump attenuation. These algorithms modulate the insulin pump delivery so that the insulin injection rate is dramatically reduced when the risk of hypoglycemia is high. Additionally, we combined these algorithms with an alert system that indicates a level of hypoglycemic risk to the user.
We demonstrated the effectiveness of Brakes and Power Brakes in reducing the incidence of hypoglycemia in two simulated scenarios: an elevated basal rate scenario and a scenario in which a bolus is delivered for a meal that is skipped. For these scenarios, the incidence of hypoglycemia using Power Brakes was reduced by 88 and 94%, respectively, where we defined hypoglycemia based on the American Diabetes Association guidelines for defining and reporting as 70 mg/dl. In the elevated basal rate scenario, no rebounds above 180 mg/dl (the desired upper limit of the control-to-range protocol) following hypoglycemia were shown to occur. We demonstrated the way the hypoglycemia alert system can trigger the intake of carbohydrates to reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia by 98%.
This article offers, for the first time, a method for smoothly reducing insulin delivery rate to prevent hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes mellitus based on a mathematically formal assessment of hypoglycemic risk. In silico, we demonstrate the way this method can prevent hypoglycemia while avoiding hyperglycemia rebounds that exceed 180 mg/dl. In conjunction with the pump attenuation algorithms, this article also proposes a system for alerting an individual of their hypoglycemic risk that contains three ""levels"" of alerts in the form of a traffic light. This alert system can be used in an advisory mode setting to alert the user to take action when hypoglycemia is imminent (""red"" light) or in a closed-loop setting where initiation of rescue action begins when the red light alert is triggered.

Long-term insulin pump treatment in girls with type 1 diabetes and eating disorders--is it feasible?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20879965/),"
This study evaluated the feasibility of insulin pump treatment in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and eating disorders (ED).
Sixty-three girls >10 years old were included in the study. Forty-eight were treated with pump (no-ED-pump group); 15 had ED, of whom eight were treated with pump (ED-pump group), and seven were treated with multiple daily injections (MDI) (ED-MDI group).
Girls in the ED-pump group had higher hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) compared to those in the no-ED-pump group both before and after pump initiation (P = 0.007). In the ED-pump group, levels 0-6 months after pump initiation were slightly but not significantly lower compared to baseline reference values (8.48% vs. 8.84%, respectively; P = 0.42). In the no-ED-pump group there was a significant decrease in HbA1c level 0-6 months after pump initiation (8.03% vs. 7.67%, respectively; P = 0.004). Thereafter HbA1c levels were not different from baseline reference on both groups. The rate of hypoglycemic episodes was similar in the ED pump and no-ED-pump groups (0.9 vs. 1.0 episodes per 100 patient-years, respectively). Prior to diagnosis of ED, mean HbA1c levels in the ED-pump group and the ED-MDI group were similar: 9.24 ± 1.25% versus 8.47 ± 1.30% (P = 0.51). In the time intervals after the diagnosis of ED, mean HbA1c level of all measurements in the eight girls in the ED-pump group was significantly lower compared with the seven patients in the ED-MDI group: 9.07 ± 1.33% versus 10.40 ± 2.01% (P = 0.04).
Treatment with an insulin pump was feasible in girls with T1DM and ED and resulted in significantly lower HbA1c levels compared to the ED-MDI group.

All diabetes medications except metformin were discontinued at baseline, and insulin pump therapy was initiated. PRO were measured at baseline and end of study using two measures of health-related quality of life (QOL)--the Diabetes Symptom Checklist-Revised (DSC-R) and the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D)--and a measure of treatment satisfaction--the Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ).
The combined study population (n = 54) experienced significant reductions in DSC-R total symptoms, as well as a significant increase in the EQ-5D Visual Analog Scale score. The OAD cohort experienced no changes in any QOL measure; the Basal and MDI cohorts each experienced significant improvements in several QOL measures. The combined study population experienced significant improvements in all IDSRQ measures except treatment interference, for which change was not significant. The OAD cohort experienced significant improvements in perceived clinical efficacy and overall treatment preference; the Basal and MDI cohorts each experienced significant improvements in five of the seven IDSRQ measures.

[Insulin pump therapy: indications and risks - Case 7/2010].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20730708/),"
HISTORY, ADMISSION FINDINGS AND TREATMENT: In a 35-year-old pregnant woman (pat. 1) with type 1 diabetes, insulin pump therapy was initiated because of very fluctuating blood glucose levels with severe hypoglycaemias and worsening hypoglycaemia unawareness during pregnancy. In a 45-year-old female (pat. 2) with type 1 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia with loss of consciousness occurred because of dysfunction of the insulin pump and subsequent several-fold application of bolus insulin. After intravenous administration of 40% glucose solution the patient recovered soon and was admitted to hospital for further treatment.
With CSII blood glucose levels were in patient 1 more stable and HbA (1c) remained within the normal range. The pregnancy proceeded without further complications and the patient gave birth to a healthy boy on time. In patient 2, insulin pump treatment was reinititated after a temporarily change to an intensified conventional insulin regimen and an insulin pump therapy education update.
The main advantage of an insulin pump therapy is the higher flexibility regarding the basal insulin rate, in particular in patients with highly fluctuating insulin demand during the day and/or hypoglycaemia unawareness. As a disadvantage can be seen the higher costs, especially as superiority of insulin pump therapy compared to intensified conventional treatment could not be shown for all patients.

There are few reports on rates and predictors for pump discontinuation in the pediatric population.
To study the rate of and predictors for insulin pump discontinuation among pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes.
Medical chart review of 530 patients with type 1 diabetes who had started pump therapy between 2000 and 2008 in our center revealed that 11.3% had discontinued pump use after 3 d to 5 yr; of these, 9.1% discontinued pump use at least 3 months after initiation. Relevant data were retrieved from the files of these patients and from those of 100 randomly assigned pump-treated patients.
The pump discontinuation group had a significantly higher proportion of female patients (75 vs. 46%, p = 0.001) and patients above 10 yr of age (93.8 vs. 80%, p = 0.03) than the reference group. Comparable findings were noted for age at diagnosis, pubertal stage, anthropometric data and duration of diabetes at pump initiation, rate of severe hypoglycemic and diabetic ketoacidosis episodes. There were no between-group differences in number of daily insulin injections and blood glucose measurements before pump treatment. At pump initiation, HbA(1c) was significantly higher in patients discontinuing pump therapy than in the controls (8.6 ± 1.4 vs. 8.1 ± 1.0, p = 0.02). This difference was maintained at the last follow-up visit recorded.
Almost 90% of our cohort maintained pump therapy. Female gender, age older than 10 years in girls and poor metabolic control at pump initiation were associated with higher risk for pump discontinuation - for such patients intensified individual and family support may serve to maximize persistent pump therapy.

Sensor-augmented pump therapy from the diagnosis of childhood type 1 diabetes: results of the Paediatric Onset Study (ONSET) after 12 months of treatment.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20711715/),"
The value of managing children with type 1 diabetes using a combination of insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring starting from diagnosis for improving subsequent glycaemic control and preserving residual beta cell function was determined.
A total of 160 children (aged 1-16 years, mean ± SD: 8.7 ± 4.4 years; 47.5% girls) were randomised to receive insulin pump treatment with continuous glucose monitoring or conventional self-monitoring blood glucose measurements. The primary outcome was the level of HbA(1c) after 12 months. Other analyses included fasting C-peptide, glycaemic variability, sensor usage, adverse events, children's health-related quality of life and parent's wellbeing.
HbA(1c) was not significantly different between the two groups, but patients with regular sensor use had lower values (mean 7.1%, 95% CI 6.8-7.4%) compared with the combined group with no or low sensor usage (mean 7.6%, 95% CI 7.3-7.9%; p=0.032). At 12 months, glycaemic variability was lower in the sensor group (mean amplitude of glycaemic excursions 80.2 ± 26.2 vs 92.0 ± 33.7; p=0.037). Higher C-peptide concentrations were seen in sensor-treated 12- to 16-year-old patients (0.25 ± 0.12 nmol/l) compared with those treated with insulin pump alone (0.19 ± 0.07 nmol/l; p=0.033). Severe hypoglycaemia was reported only in the group without sensors (four episodes).
Sensor-augmented pump therapy starting from the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes can be associated with less decline in fasting C-peptide particularly in older children, although regular sensor use is a prerequisite for improved glycaemic control.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by means of insulin pump devices is considered to be one of the most optimal therapies to achieve treatment targets in patients with diabetes mellitus. In CSII, the insulin is delivered through Teflon catheters or steel needle infusion sets, which need to be renewed on a regular basis. This pilot study was performed to investigate the optimal change frequency in daily practice and to explore potential problems that may occur when the sets are used for a more prolonged time than the recommended up to 72 hours of usage (Teflon catheters).
Twelve patients with type 1 diabetes participated in the trial [age (mean +/- STD): 40.3 +/- 12.6 years, body mass index: 26.2 +/- 3.3 kg/m(2), hemoglobin A1c: 6.7 +/- 0.6%]. They were asked to wear their infusion set (Comfort or Silhouette) for increasing periods of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days. After each use, patients completed standardized questionnaires regarding technical and medical issues associated with infusion set use. A health care professional investigated the infusion sites and infusion sets and completed an ""infusion set inspection"" questionnaire. Blood glucose was measured and recorded to assess a potential influence of duration of catheter use on glycemic control.
Infusion set and injection site problems (itching, bruising, swelling, and pain) started to occur in measurable amounts on the 3rd day of catheter use, and about 40% of patients reported significant issues when using a catheter for 5 days. In parallel, there was a consistent increase in mean daily blood glucose levels that correlated with the number of days of catheter use (e.g., day 1: 7.5 +/- 3.8 mmol/liter, day 3: 8.4 +/- 4.2 mmol/liter, day 5: 9.0 +/- 4.0 mmol/liter, day 7: 11.6 +/- 2.2 mmol/liter, p < 0.05 vs day 1).
Using the catheters for 2 days resulted in a safe and well-tolerated therapy. Clinically relevant adverse events started to occur during the 3rd day and their incidence increased constantly with longer use. This was associated with undesired changes in mean glycemic control. Data support the recommendation by the drug and device manufacturers that insulin pump catheters should only be used for 48-72 hours to avoid adverse events and potential metabolic deterioration.

Outpatient-to-inpatient transition of insulin pump therapy: successes and continuing challenges.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20663450/),"
Insulin pump therapy is a complex technology prone to errors when employed in the hospital setting. When patients on insulin pump therapy require hospitalization, practitioners caring for them must decide whether to allow continued pump use. We provide the largest review regarding transitioning insulin pump therapy from the outpatient to inpatient setting.
Records of inpatient insulin pump users were retrospectively analyzed at a metropolitan Phoenix hospital between January 2006 and December 2009. Adherence to institutional procedures on insulin pump use was assessed, glycemic control was determined, and adverse events were examined.
We examined records on 65 patients with insulin pumps, totaling 125 hospitalizations. Mean (standard deviation) patient age was 55 (17) years, diabetes duration was 27 (14) years, pump duration was 6 (5) years, length of hospital stay was 4.7 (6.3) days, hemoglobin A1c was 7.3 (1.3)%, 85% had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 57% were women, and 97% were white. Admissions involving insulin pumps increased (23 in 2006, 17 in 2007, 40 in 2008, and 45 in 2009). Insulin pump therapy was continued in 83 (66%) hospitalizations. Among these hospitalizations, endocrinology consultations were obtained in 89%, consent agreements were found in 83%, insulin pump order sets were completed in 89%, admission glucose was checked in 100%, and nursing assessments of pump insertion sites were documented in 89%, but bedside insulin pump flow sheets were found in only 55%. Mean glucose of 175 (57) mg/dl was not significantly different than that in hospitalizations where insulin pumps were discontinued [175 (42) mg/dl] or used intermittently [177 (7) mg/dl]. There was one instance of a pump catheter kinking; however, no other adverse events (pump site infections, mechanical pump failure, diabetic ketoacidosis) were observed, and there were no use-related fatalities.
Most patients using insulin pumps can safely have their therapy transitioned when hospitalized. A policy on inpatient continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion use can be successfully implemented. Compliance with required procedures can be achieved, although there was room to improve adherence with some process measures. Further study is needed to determine how to optimize glycemic control when pumps are allowed during hospitalization.

The impact of health insurance coverage on pediatric diabetes management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20630611/),"
To examine the association between health insurance coverage, insulin management plans, and their impact on diabetes control in a pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus clinic population.
Retrospective cohort design drawn from the medical records of the Pediatric Endocrinology Clinic at the University of Louisville, Kentucky.
Out of 701 patients, 223 had public insurance, and 478 had private insurance. 77% of publically insured used two or three injections per day vs. 40% private. Conversely, 58% of privately insured used a multiple daily injection (MDI) plan or insulin pump (vs. 21%). 84% of MDI patients had private insurance with 93% using insulin pens compared with 38% of publically insured. Mean HbA1c was 8.6% for privately insured vs. 9.8% public, p<0.0001. Privately insured MDI and pump patients had the lowest HbA1cs.
Insurance type had a significant effect on the insulin management plan used and was the most significant factor in overall diabetes control. Limitations on insulin pen use and number of glucose test strips may play a role in the decreased use of MDI/insulin pumps by publicly insured patients. Addressing factors related to insurance type, including availability of resources, could substantially improve diabetes control in those with public insurance.

Effectiveness of sensor-augmented insulin-pump therapy in type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20587585/),"
Recently developed technologies for the treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus include a variety of pumps and pumps with glucose sensors.
In this 1-year, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, we compared the efficacy of sensor-augmented pump therapy (pump therapy) with that of a regimen of multiple daily insulin injections (injection therapy) in 485 patients (329 adults and 156 children) with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes. Patients received recombinant insulin analogues and were supervised by expert clinical teams. The primary end point was the change from the baseline glycated hemoglobin level.
At 1 year, the baseline mean glycated hemoglobin level (8.3% in the two study groups) had decreased to 7.5% in the pump-therapy group, as compared with 8.1% in the injection-therapy group (P<0.001). The proportion of patients who reached the glycated hemoglobin target (<7%) was greater in the pump-therapy group than in the injection-therapy group. The rate of severe hypoglycemia in the pump-therapy group (13.31 cases per 100 person-years) did not differ significantly from that in the injection-therapy group (13.48 per 100 person-years, P=0.58). There was no significant weight gain in either group.
In both adults and children with inadequately controlled type 1 diabetes, sensor-augmented pump therapy resulted in significant improvement in glycated hemoglobin levels, as compared with injection therapy. A significantly greater proportion of both adults and children in the pump-therapy group than in the injection-therapy group reached the target glycated hemoglobin level.

Patients' perception and future acceptance of an artificial pancreas.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20513325/),"
Little is known of patient acceptance of an artificial pancreas (AP). The purpose of this study was to investigate future acceptance of an AP and its determinants.
Patients with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy were interviewed using questions based on the technology acceptance model and completed the diabetes treatment and satisfaction questionnaire (DTSQ).
Twenty-two adults with type 1 diabetes participated. Half of the patients were followed in a university hospital, and the others were under treatment in an affiliated teaching hospital. Half of the patients were male. The mean DTSQ score was 29 (range 23-33). The AP was perceived as likely to be useful. Perceived advantages were a stable glucose regulation, less need for self-monitoring of blood glucose, relief of daily concerns, and time saving. Participants were confident in their capability to use the system. Although many participants (58%) had been reluctant to start continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, the majority (79%) felt they would have no barriers to start using the AP. Trust in the AP was related to the quality of glucose control it would provide. Almost everyone expressed the intention to use the new system when available, even if it would initially not cover 24/24 hours.
The overall attitude on the AP was positive. Intention to use was dependent on trust in the AP, which was related to the quality of glucose control provided by the AP.

Evolution of diabetes insulin delivery devices.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20513314/),"
The first manufactured insulin pump was introduced in the 1970s and the first insulin pens in 1985; since then, many improvements have been made to both devices. The advantages of pens over syringes have been confirmed in numerous studies and include greater accuracy, ease of use, patient satisfaction, quality of life, and adherence. United States claims database analyses indicate that the improved adherence made possible by use of an insulin pen has the potential to reduce diabetes care costs when compared with using a vial and syringe. Features of certain advanced pump models include the ability to connect wirelessly to a blood glucose meter or to a subcutaneous interstitial glucose sensor for semicontinuous glucose-driven insulin rate adjustment. A new trend in the design of insulin pumps is the tubing-free patch pump that adheres directly to the skin. The low rate of insulin pen usage in the United States compared with European countries and the fact that many patients report that they are not offered the option of an insulin pen by their physician suggest that there is a need to increase patient and provider awareness of the currently available devices for insulin administration.

Is insulin pump therapy better than injection for adolescents with diabetes?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20488572/),"
Insulin pump therapy is a commonly used alternative to multiple daily injections (MDI) in the treatment of pediatric type 1 diabetes. The aim of the current study was to examine whether there are different medical and psychosocial outcomes for adolescents using MDI versus pump therapy as experienced in a naturally occurring context of self- or doctor-chosen insulin regimens.
Adolescents and their parents completed questionnaires assessing quality of life and parenting stress. A1C levels were obtained from the medical record.
Metabolic and psychosocial outcomes did not differ significantly between adolescents using pump therapy and adolescents using MDI. Higher parental stress was associated with older children, lower quality of life, and higher A1C levels.
Physicians might present this information to families along with the potential advantages and disadvantages of pumps and injections.

Insulin pump access issues for visually impaired people with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20444517/),"
An electronic literature search was conducted to determine suitability of insulin pumps for people with type 1 diabetes who have visual impairment.
Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL databases as well as the Internet were searched. Search terms used were insulin pump therapy, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, blindness, vision disorders, visually impaired persons and low vision. Only two relevant articles were identified regarding accessibility issues for insulin pump use by vision-impaired people with diabetes.
Insulin pumps currently available do not have features that are sufficiently compatible with severely visually impaired people. None have speech output, user guides in Braille or accessible diabetes software for personal computers and only one pump has good visual display characteristics.
As serious health consequences can result from improper use of insulin pumps, industry should design pumps with features that can be safely and easily accessed by people with severe vision loss.

Unexplained hypoglycemia in a pediatric diabetic patient can perplex even the savviest health care providers and lead to an extensive medical workup. We present here the cases of 2 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with insulin pumps who were hospitalized for episodes of hypoglycemia. Review of their insulin pumps revealed normal basal and bolus insulin delivery. However, subsequent review of the priming history in the pump revealed that both children were receiving additional insulin under the manual-prime function, which is not included in the daily totals and, therefore, was initially unnoticed. Ultimately, both children confessed to surreptitiously using this priming function to self-administer extra insulin. It is important that health care professionals who are caring for diabetic patients be aware of this possibility.

A hazard analysis for a generic insulin infusion pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20307387/),"
Researchers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/Center for Device and Radiological Health/Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories have been exploring the concept of model-based engineering as a means for improving the quality of medical device software. Insulin pumps were chosen as a research subject because their design provides the desired degree of research complexity and these types of devices present an ongoing regulatory challenge.
Insulin pump hazards and their contributing factors are considered in the context of a highly abstract generic insulin infusion pump (GIIP) model. Hazards were identified by consulting with manufacturers, pump users, and clinicians; by reviewing national and international standards and adverse event reports collected by the FDA; and from workshops sponsored by Diabetes Technology Society. This information has been consolidated in tabular form to facilitate further community analysis and discussion.
A generic insulin infusion pump model architecture has been established. A fairly comprehensive hazard analysis document, corresponding to the GIIP model, is presented in this article.
We believe that this work represents the genesis of an insulin pump safety reference standard upon which future insulin pump designs can be based to help ensure a basic level of safety. More interaction with the diabetes community is needed to assure the quality of this safety modeling process.

Parental involvement buffers associations between pump duration and metabolic control among adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20219778/),"
To examine pump duration associations with adolescents' metabolic control and whether parental involvement moderated this association.
This study used a cross-sectional sample of 10- to 14-year-olds with diabetes (N = 252, 53.6% female) and parents' reported parental involvement; HbA1c was obtained from medical records. Half (50.8%) were on an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII), with the remainder prescribed multiple daily injections (MDI).
Adolescents on CSII displayed better HbA1c than those on MDI. A curvilinear association revealed that participants on CSII for <2 years showed a positive pump duration-HbA1c association, while those on CSII longer showed no association. Parental involvement interacted with pump duration to predict HbA1c. Pump duration was associated with poorer HbA1c only when parents were relatively uninvolved.
Within the limitations of a cross-sectional design, data suggest that adolescents on CSII have better HbA1c than those on MDI, but may experience a period of deterioration that can be offset by parental involvement.

Prevention of nocturnal hypoglycemia using predictive alarm algorithms and insulin pump suspension.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20200307/),"
The aim of this study was to develop a partial closed-loop system to safely prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia by suspending insulin delivery when hypoglycemia is predicted in type 1 diabetes.
Forty subjects with type 1 diabetes (age range 12-39 years) were studied overnight in the hospital. For the first 14 subjects, hypoglycemia (<60 mg/dl) was induced by gradually increasing the basal insulin infusion rate (without the use of pump shutoff algorithms). During the subsequent 26 patient studies, pump shutoff occurred when either three of five (n = 10) or two of five (n = 16) algorithms predicted hypoglycemia based on the glucose levels measured with the FreeStyle Navigator (Abbott Diabetes Care).
The standardized protocol induced hypoglycemia on 13 (93%) of the 14 nights. With use of a voting scheme that required three algorithms to trigger insulin pump suspension, nocturnal hypoglycemia was prevented during 6 (60%) of 10 nights. When the voting scheme was changed to require only two algorithms to predict hypoglycemia to trigger pump suspension, hypoglycemia was prevented during 12 (75%) of 16 nights. In the latter study, there were 25 predictions of hypoglycemia because some subjects had multiple hypoglycemic events during a night, and hypoglycemia was prevented for 84% of these events.
Using algorithms to shut off the insulin pump when hypoglycemia is predicted, it is possible to prevent hypoglycemia on 75% of nights (84% of events) when it would otherwise be predicted to occur.

This study compared the stability of commercially available, rapid-acting insulin in the novel tubeless, skin-adhering Solo insulin pump over 6 days at extreme environmental conditions.
Forty-eight pumps for each tested analog were loaded with three different insulin lots and operated at 30 U/day (three sets of 12 pumps) and 15 U/day (one set of 12 pumps) with basal/bolus delivery patterns for 6 days under extreme climatic (37 degrees C, 40% relative humidity) and mechanical (35 strokes/min) stresses. The insulin solutions dispensed were sampled periodically and analyzed for potency, related substances, high molecular weight proteins (HMWP), and preservative content by high-performance liquid chromatography techniques. Biological activity (bioidentity) was demonstrated by an abrupt decrease in blood glucose in rabbits. Solutions were inspected for visual appearance and measured for pH levels.
During the 6-day sampling period, the potency of all insulin samples was maintained at 95.0-105.0% of the bulk solution concentration of the insulin vials. The levels of HMWP and related substances remained well below labeling limits. The preservative concentration decreased with time but remained bacteriostatic effective. Solutions maintained pH and clarity and were particulate free. The biological activity was verified.

Closed-loop systems link continuous glucose measurements to insulin delivery. We aimed to establish whether closed-loop insulin delivery could control overnight blood glucose in young people.
We undertook three randomised crossover studies in 19 patients aged 5-18 years with type 1 diabetes of duration 6.4 years (SD 4.0). We compared standard continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and closed-loop delivery (n=13; APCam01); closed-loop delivery after rapidly and slowly absorbed meals (n=7; APCam02); and closed-loop delivery and standard treatment after exercise (n=10; APCam03). Allocation was by computer-generated random code. Participants were masked to plasma and sensor glucose. In APCam01, investigators were masked to plasma glucose. During closed-loop nights, glucose measurements were fed every 15 min into a control algorithm calculating rate of insulin infusion, and a nurse adjusted the insulin pump. During control nights, patients' standard pump settings were applied. Primary outcomes were time for which plasma glucose concentration was 3.91-8.00 mmol/L or 3.90 mmol/L or lower. Analysis was per protocol. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN18155883.
17 patients were studied for 33 closed-loop and 21 continuous infusion nights. Primary outcomes did not differ significantly between treatment groups in APCam01 (12 analysed; target range, median 52% [IQR 43-83] closed loop vs 39% [15-51] standard treatment, p=0.06; <or=3.90 mmol/L, 1% [0-7] vs 2% [0-41], p=0.13), APCam02 (six analysed; target range, rapidly 53% [48-57] vs slowly absorbed meal 55% [37-64], p=0.97; <or=3.90 mmol/L, 0% [0-4] vs 0% [0-0], p=0.16]), and APCam03 (nine analysed; target range 78% [60-92] closed loop vs 43% [25-65] control, p=0.0245, not significant at corrected level; <or=3.90 mmol/L, 10% [2-15] vs 6% [0-44], p=0.27). A secondary analysis of pooled data documented increased time in the target range (60% [51-88] vs 40% [18-61]; p=0.0022) and reduced time for which glucose concentrations were 3.90 mmol/L or lower (2.1% (0.0-10.0) vs 4.1% (0.0-42.0); p=0.0304). No events with plasma glucose concentration lower than 3.0 mmol/L were recorded during closed-loop delivery, compared with nine events during standard treatment.
Closed-loop systems could reduce risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

SMARTDIAB is a platform designed to support the monitoring, management, and treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), by combining state-of-the-art approaches in the fields of database (DB) technologies, communications, simulation algorithms, and data mining. SMARTDIAB consists mainly of two units: 1) the patient unit (PU); and 2) the patient management unit (PMU), which communicate with each other for data exchange. The PMU can be accessed by the PU through the internet using devices, such as PCs/laptops with direct internet access or mobile phones via a Wi-Fi/General Packet Radio Service access network. The PU consists of an insulin pump for subcutaneous insulin infusion to the patient and a continuous glucose measurement system. The aforementioned devices running a user-friendly application gather patient's related information and transmit it to the PMU. The PMU consists of a diabetes data management system (DDMS), a decision support system (DSS) that provides risk assessment for long-term diabetes complications, and an insulin infusion advisory system (IIAS), which reside on a Web server. The DDMS can be accessed from both medical personnel and patients, with appropriate security access rights and front-end interfaces. The DDMS, apart from being used for data storage/retrieval, provides also advanced tools for the intelligent processing of the patient's data, supporting the physician in decision making, regarding the patient's treatment. The IIAS is used to close the loop between the insulin pump and the continuous glucose monitoring system, by providing the pump with the appropriate insulin infusion rate in order to keep the patient's glucose levels within predefined limits. The pilot version of the SMARTDIAB has already been implemented, while the platform's evaluation in clinical environment is being in progress.

When to treat a diabetic patient using an external insulin pump. Expert consensus. Société francophone du diabète (ex ALFEDIAM) 2009.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20074990/),"
For years, external insulin pumps have enjoyed proven efficacy as an intensive diabetes treatment to improve glycaemic control and reduce hypoglycaemia. Since the last ALFEDIAM guidelines in 1995, however, basal-bolus treatment using a combination of long- and short-acting insulin analogues have emerged and could challenge, at a lower cost, the efficacy of pumps using rapid-acting insulin analogues, considered the 'gold standard' of insulin treatment. Nevertheless, given its theoretical and practical advantages, some patients will derive more benefit from pump treatment. These cases have been carefully evaluated in the literature by a panel of experts appointed by ALFEDIAM to determine the indications for pump treatment. In patients with type 1 diabetes, persistent elevated HbA(1c) despite multiple daily injections (MDI), and repeated hypoglycaemia and high glycaemic variability, represent the most validated indications. In patients with type 2 diabetes, pump treatment may be indicated in cases of MDI failure to achieve HbA(1c) targets. Absolute contraindications are rare, and comprise severe psychiatric disorders, rapidly progressing ischaemic or proliferative retinopathy before laser treatment and exposure to high magnetic fields. Relative contraindications are mostly related to the patient's lack of compliance or inability to cope with the treatment, and need to be evaluated individually to clearly assess the benefit/risk ratio for the given patient. However, as these conditions are progressive, there should also be annual reassessment of the appropriateness of pump treatment. Specific education on pump treatment initially and throughout the follow-up, delivered by experienced medical and paramedical teams, are the best guarantees of treatment efficacy and safety.

The dual-wave bolus feature in type 1 diabetes adult users of insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20063022/),"
One of the attributes of CSII (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) is its ability to tailor prandial insulin delivery to the composition of a meal and anticipated glycemic effects. The dual-wave bolus (DWB) is a tool implemented in contemporary insulin pumps that delivers a combination of an instant insulin bolus followed by a square bolus (SB) infused over several hours. We assessed the effectiveness of DWB in 56 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) who were on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion via insulin pump for at least 2 years. We divided patients into frequent (DWB+, n = 32) and infrequent (DWB-, n = 24) DWB users (>20% vs. <20% of daily bolus dose delivered as SB). CSII implementation resulted in a decrease of adjusted HbA1c level by 0.80% (95% CI 0.67-0.93, P < 0.0001) and adjusted mean glycemia by 18.4 mg/dl (95% CI 15.3-21.4, P < 0.0001) in the whole cohort within the first year of observation. It was sustained in the second year, but without further improvement. Frequent DWB use was associated with male sex (59% vs. 17%, p = 0.001) and shorter duration of T1DM (3.4 vs. 11.3 yrs, p < 0.0001), but not with patients' age (25.7 vs. 27.0 years, P = 0.6). DWB+ patients improved their HbA1c by 0.45% more (95% CI 0.20-0.71, P = 0.0009) than DWB- individuals. In conclusion, DWB might be a tool potentially helping to improve glycemic control in T1DM adult users of insulin pumps. Male patients and those with a shorter duration of diabetes seem to use it more willingly.

A novel adaptive basal therapy based on the value and rate of change of blood glucose.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20144423/),"
Modern insulin pump therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus offers the freedom to program several basal profiles that may accommodate diurnal ariability in insulin sensitivity and activity level. However, these basal profiles do not change even if a pending hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic event is foreseen. New insulin pumps could receive a direct feed of glucose values from a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and could enable dynamic basal adaptation to improve glycemic control.
The proposed method is a two-step procedure. After the design of an initial basal profile, an adaptation of the basal rate is suggested as a gain multiplier based on the current CGM glucose value and its rate of change (ROC). Taking the glucose value and its ROC as axes, a two-dimensional plane is divided into a nine-zone mosaic, where each zone is given a predefined basal multiplier; for example, a basal multiplier of zero indicates a recommendation to shut off the pump.
The proposed therapy was evaluated on 20 in silico subjects (ten adults and ten adolescents) in the Food and Drug Administration-approved UVa/Padova simulator. Compared with conventional basal therapy, the proposed basal adjustment improved the percentage of glucose levels that stayed in the range of 60-180 mg/dl for all 20 subjects. In addition, the adaptive basal therapy reduced the average blood glucose index values.
The proposed therapy provides the flexibility to account for insulin sensitivity variations that may result from stress and/or physical activities. Because of its simplicity, the proposed method could be embedded in a chip in a future artificial pancreatic beta cell or used in a ""smart"" insulin pump.

Closed-loop artificial pancreas using subcutaneous glucose sensing and insulin delivery and a model predictive control algorithm: preliminary studies in Padova and Montpellier.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20144414/),"
New effort has been made to develop closed-loop glucose control, using subcutaneous (SC) glucose sensing and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) from a pump, and a control algorithm. An approach based on a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm has been utilized during closed-loop control in type 1 diabetes patients. Here we describe the preliminary clinical experience with this approach. Six type 1 diabetes patients (three in each of two clinical investigation centers in Padova and Montpellier), using CSII, aged 36 +/- 8 and 48 +/- 6 years, duration of diabetes 12 +/- 8 and 29 +/- 4 years, hemoglobin A1c 7.4% +/- 0.1% and 7.3% +/- 0.3%, body mass index 23.2 +/- 0.3 and 28.4 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2), respectively, were studied on two occasions during 22 h overnight hospital admissions 2-4 weeks apart. A Freestyle Navigator(R) continuous glucose monitor and an OmniPod insulin pump were applied in each trial. Admission 1 used open-loop control, while admission 2 employed closed-loop control using our MPC algorithm. In Padova, two out of three subjects showed better performance with the closed-loop system compared to open loop. Altogether, mean overnight plasma glucose (PG) levels were 134 versus 111 mg/dl during open loop versus closed loop, respectively. The percentage of time spent at PG > 140 mg/dl was 45% versus 12%, while postbreakfast mean PG was 165 versus 156 mg/dl during open loop versus closed loop, respectively. Also, in Montpellier, two patients out of three showed a better glucose control during closed-loop trials. Avoidance of nocturnal hypoglycemic excursions was a clear benefit during algorithm-guided insulin delivery in all cases. This preliminary set of studies demonstrates that closed-loop control based entirely on SC glucose sensing and insulin delivery is feasible and can be applied to improve glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes, although the algorithm needs to be further improved to achieve better glycemic control.

Insulin pump safety meeting: summary report.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20144372/),"
Diabetes Technology Society convened a panel of insulin pump experts in Bethesda, Maryland, on November 12, 2008, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration. The group consisted of physicians, nurses, diabetes educators, and engineers from across the United States. The panel members (1) discussed safety features of insulin pump therapy and (2) recommended adjustments to current insulin pump design and use to enhance overall safety. Software and hardware features of insulin pumps were analyzed from engineering, medical, nursing, and pump-user perspectives. The meeting was divided into four sections: (1) Engineering Safety-Designing Software and Hardware for Insulin Pump Therapy; (2) Patient Safety-Selecting Patients and Clinical Settings for Insulin Pump Use; (3) Clinical Safety-Determining and Delivering Insulin Dosages Using Insulin Pump Therapy; and (4) Personal Experiences-A Panel Discussion about Insulin Pump Safety. Six aspects of insulin pump technology were noted to present potential safety problems: (1) software, (2) wireless communication, (3) hardware, (4) alarms, (5) human factors, and (6) bolus-dose calculation. There was consensus among meeting participants that insulin pump therapy is beneficial in patients of all ages and that insulin pump safety must be assured through careful regulation.

Relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis secondary to insulin pump malfunction diagnosed by capillary blood 3-hydroxybutyrate: a case report.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19918445/),"
A 14 year old female with type 1 diabetes mellitus and a subcutaneous insulin pump was treated for diabetic ketoacidosis presumed secondary to dietary indiscretion, and then restarted her subcutaneous insulin pump after exchanging the tubing. An hour later, nursing review determined that she was using outdated insulin in the pump, and it was exchanged. However, 5 hours later relapse was suggested by a rise in capillary blood 3-hydroxybutyrate, in spite of a normal serum anion gap and a minimal increase in serum bicarbonate. Insulin pump failure was suspected, and the patient was treated for relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis. Following resolution, her insulin pump was replaced without further complications. Capillary blood levels of 3-hydroxybutyrate may be sensitive, early indicators of relapse of diabetic ketoacidosis, and are easily obtained.

Analysis of continuous patient data from the Czech National Register of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes using insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19853948/),"
Patient data from the Czech National Register of patients treated with Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) were evaluated to compare treatment indication, efficacy and safety with specific regard to the type of diabetes (T1 vs. T2).
Evaluation was done on complete data sets of at least 3 years from patients with either T1 diabetes (n=730, 93.1%) or T2 diabetes (n=54, 6.9%) between 1995 and 2006.
HbA(1c) decreased from 9.65 (+/-0.07) and 9.66 (+/-0.05) for T1 and T2 respectively to 8.24 (+/-0.07) for T1 and 8.52 (+/-0.27) for T2 after 1 year of treatment, 8.34 (+/-0.07) and 8.54 (+/-0.26) after 2 years and 8.44 (+/-0.07) and 8.71 (+/-0.25) after 3 years (adjusted mean values, +/-SEM). This reduction is significant for both diabetes types. Results gathered from the safety analysis revealed almost comparable results for both patient groups (rates of adverse events of 42.5 and 34.8 for T1 and T2, per 100 patients and year).
Both patient groups achieved substantial reduction of HbA(1c). Safety evaluation showed that fewer patients with T2 diabetes were affected by adverse events. According to that CSII treatment for patients with T2 diabetes is similarly effective with a slightly better safety profile.

Incremental value of continuous glucose monitoring when starting pump therapy in patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes: the RealTrend study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19767384/),"
To compare the improvements in glycemic control associated with transitioning to insulin pump therapy in patients using continuous glucose monitoring versus standard blood glucose self-monitoring.
The RealTrend study was a 6-month, randomized, parallel-group, two-arm, open-label study of 132 adults and children with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (A1C >or=8%) being treated with multiple daily injections. One group was fitted with the Medtronic MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time system (PRT group), an insulin pump with integrated continuous subcutaneous glucose monitoring (CGM) capability, with instructions to wear CGM sensors at least 70% of the time. Conventional insulin pump therapy was initiated in the other group (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII] group). Outcome measures included A1C and glycemic variability.
A total of 115 patients completed the study. Between baseline and trial end, A1C improved significantly in both groups (PRT group -0.81 +/- 1.09%, P < 0.001; CSII group -0.57 +/- 0.94%, P < 0.001), with no significant difference between groups. When the 91 patients who were fully protocol-compliant (including CGM sensor wear >or=70% of the time) were considered, A1C improvement was significantly greater in the PRT group (P = 0.004) (PRT group -0.96 +/- 0.93%, P < 0.001; CSII group -0.55 +/- 0.93%, P < 0.001). Hyperglycemia parameters decreased in line with improvements in A1C with no impact on hypoglycemia.
CGM-enabled insulin pump therapy improves glycemia more than conventional pump therapy during the first 6 months of pump use in patients who wear CGM sensors at least 70% of the time.

"Discontinuation of insulin pump treatment in children, adolescents, and young adults. A multicenter analysis based on the DPV database in Germany and Austria.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19566740/),"
Insulin pump therapy is well established in the treatment of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Most studies focus on outcome parameters like hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), hypoglycemia, and quality of life, whereas few reports address patients who discontinue pump therapy.
This survey focuses on the discontinuation rate of insulin pump treatment in the pediatric and young adult age group.
The prospective multicenter Diabetes Patienten Verlausdokumentation (DPV) (electronic diabetes patient documentation system) database has been established since 1990 and is broadly used in Germany and Austria. All pump users among the participating centers documented since 1995 were included in this analysis.
In total, 11 710 patients with type 1 diabetes were recorded as treated with insulin pumps. In total, 463 patients (4%) switched from insulin pump treatment to multiple daily injections (MDI). In the group of patients who stopped with pump treatment, the mean duration of pump therapy was 1.7 yr (SE +/- 0.06 yr), 60.5% of patients were female. Subdivided into age groups, the discontinuation rate was lowest in the age group < 5 yr (0.1%), followed by the groups aged 5-10 yr (0.3%) and 15-20 yr (0.8%). The group aged 10-15 yr showed the highest rate of discontinuation (2%).
The discontinuation rate of insulin pump therapy is, in general, low (4%). The younger the patients at the time of initiating insulin pump treatment, the lower is the discontinuation rate. The highest rate was seen in adolescents aged 10-15 yr. Girls stopped insulin pump treatment more often than boys (60.5% vs. 39.5%).

Glycaemic impact of patient-led use of sensor-guided pump therapy in type 1 diabetes: a randomised controlled trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19396424/),"
The objective of this study was to assess the impact of patient-led sensor-guided pump management on glycaemic control, and compare the effect with that of standard insulin pump therapy.
An open multicentre parallel randomised controlled trial was conducted at five tertiary diabetes centres. Participants aged 13.0-40.0 years with well-controlled type 1 diabetes were randomised 1:1 to either study group for 3 months. Randomisation was carried out using a central computer-generated schedule. Participants in the intervention group used sensor-guided pump management; no instructive guidelines in interpreting real-time data were provided ('patient-led' use). Participants in the control group continued their original insulin pump regimen. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and HbA(1c) level were used to assess outcomes. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of time in the target glycaemic range during the 3 month study period (derived from CGM, target range 4-10 mmol/l). Secondary outcomes were difference in HbA(1c), time in hypoglycaemic (< or =3.9 mmol/l) and hyperglycaemic (> or =10.1 mmol/l) ranges and glycaemic variability.
Sixty-two participants were recruited and randomised; 5/31 and 2/31 withdrew from intervention and control groups, respectively, leaving 26/31 and 29/31 for the intention-to-treat analyses. When adjusted for baseline values, the mean end-of-study HbA(1c) was 0.43% lower in the intervention group compared with the control group (95% CI 0.19 to 0.75%; p = 0.009). No difference was observed in CGM-derived time in target (measured difference 1.72; 95% CI -5.37 to 8.81), hypoglycaemic (0.54; 95% CI -3.48 to 4.55) or hyperglycaemic (-2.18; 95% CI -10.0 to 5.69) range or in glycaemic variability (-0.29; 95% CI -0.34 to 0.28). Within the intervention group, HbA(1c) was 0.51% lower in participants with sensor use > or =70% compared with participants with sensor use <70% (95% CI -0.98 to -0.04, p = 0.04). Five episodes of device malfunction occurred.
Individuals established on insulin pump therapy can employ sensor-guided pump management to improve glycaemic control. An apparent dose-dependent effect of sensor usage was noted; however, frequent use of this technology (> or =70%) was not universally acceptable.

Consequences of delayed pump infusion line change in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19395280/),"
To systematically investigate the effect of lack of adherence to the recommended change in insulin pump infusion line use beyond 48 h and determine whether the type of insulin made a difference.
This was a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial with 20 patients with diabetes mellitus I using insulins aspart and lispro without a line change for up to 100 h. Using retrospective continuous glucose monitoring, we analyzed the average glucose over the day. Changes in serum 1,5-anhydroglucitol, carboxymethyllysine, and free 15-F(2t) isoprostane were also studied.
From Day 2 to Day 5 of the pump line use, the daily average glucose level increased from 122.7 to 163.9 mg/dl (P<.05), fasting glucose from 120.3 to 154.5 mg/dl (P<.05), postprandial glucose from 114.6 to 172.1 mg/dl (P<.05), and the daily maximum glucose from 207.7 to 242.8 dl (P<.05 for the trend). Time period that the glucose was >180 mg/dl increased from 14.5% to 38.3% (P<.05). Loss of control occurred despite increase in total daily insulin dose from 48.5+/-11.8 to 55.3+/-17.9 U (P=.05). There was no difference in loss of control between insulin types, and biomarkers measured did not change significantly.
The insulin pump infusion should be changed every 48 h in patients using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), to avoid loss of glycemic control. In the short-term, this loss of glycemic control has no impact on oxidative stress and glycation.

To describe the insulin regimens used to treat type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in youth in the United States, to explore factors related to insulin regimen, and to describe the associations between insulin regimen and clinical outcomes, particularly glycemic control.
A total of 2743 subjects participated in the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study, an observational population-based study of youth diagnosed with T1DM, conducted at 6 centers. Data collected during a study visit included clinical and sociodemographic information, body mass index, laboratory measures, and insulin regimen.
Sociodemographic characteristics were associated with insulin regimen. Insulin pump therapy was more frequently used by older youth, females, non-Hispanic whites, and families with higher income and education (P = .02 for females, P < .001 for others). Insulin pump use was associated with the lowest hemoglobin A1C levels in all age groups. A1C levels were >7.5% in >70% of adolescents, regardless of regimen.
Youth using insulin pumps had the lowest A1C; A1C was unacceptably high in adolescents. There is a need to more fully assess and understand factors associated with insulin regimens recommended by providers and the influence of race/ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status on these treatment recommendations and to develop more effective treatment strategies, particularly for adolescents.

Comparison of a multiple daily insulin injection regimen (basal once-daily glargine plus mealtime lispro) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (lispro) in type 1 diabetes: a randomized open parallel multicenter study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19389820/),"
Insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) and multiple daily injections (MDIs) with insulin glargine as basal insulin and mealtime insulin lispro have not been prospectively compared in people naïve to either regimen in a multicenter study. We aimed to help close that deficiency.
People with type 1 diabetes on NPH-based insulin therapy were randomized to CSII or glargine-based MDI (both otherwise using lispro) and followed for 24 weeks in an equivalence design. Fifty people were correctly randomized, and 43 completed the study.
Total insulin requirement (mean +/- SD) at end point was 36.2 +/- 11.5 units/day on CSII and 42.6 +/- 15.5 units/day on MDI. Mean A1C fell similarly in the two groups (CSII -0.7 +/- 0.7%; MDI -0.6 +/- 0.8%) with a baseline-adjusted difference of -0.1% (95% CI -0.5 to 0.3). Similarly, fasting blood glucose and other preprandial, postprandial, and nighttime self-monitored plasma glucose levels did not differ between the regimens, nor did measures of plasma glucose variability. On CSII, 1,152 hypoglycemia events were recorded by 23 of 28 participants (82%) and 1,022 in the MDI group by 27 of 29 patients (93%) (all hypoglycemia differences were nonsignificant). Treatment satisfaction score increased more with CSII; however, the change in score was similar for the groups. Costs were approximately 3.9 times higher for CSII.
In unselected people with type 1 diabetes naïve to CSII or insulin glargine, glycemic control is no better with the more expensive CSII therapy compared with glargine-based MDI therapy.

This study was conducted to determine efficacy and tolerability of the continued subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via an insulin pump for treatment of Cystic Fibrosis Related Diabetes (CFRD). We also tested the hypothesis that CSII would improve body weight, blood sugar control, lean body mass, whole body protein turnover, hepatic glucose production (HGP).
We recruited 9 CF patients with established diabetes and placed them on insulin pump therapy for six months. Each subject kept daily blood sugar records before and during pump use. Prior to the pump placement and at the end of six months, each patient underwent the following measurements: 1) whole body protein turnover using the stable isotope [1-(13)C] leucine; 2) DEXA scan for measurement of lean body mass; 3) anthropometric measurements; 4) Hemoglobin A1c. Patient data was compared to baseline data and the mean change from baseline was analyzed.
There was significant improvement in both fasting and post-prandial blood glucose levels, body weight, HbA1C, and lean mass. Protein catabolism as measured by leucine rate of appearance was significantly lower, as was hepatic glucose production. No patient developed hypoglycemia during the study.
This study demonstrates that CSII is safe and effective for treatment of CFRD and that metabolic benefits are also present.

Use of continuous insulin infusion pumps in young children with type 1 diabetes: a systematic review.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19401250/),"
Although insulin pump therapy has been successful in adults and adolescents, its use has been limited in young children because of perceived risk of severe or frequent hypoglycemia. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in young children with type 1 diabetes.
We searched Medline, PubMed, and CINAHL for clinical trials comparing multiple-dose injection therapy to CSII therapy in children 6 years of age or younger who were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at least 6 months prior to study. Primary outcome measures were glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and hypoglycemic episodes. Other outcomes of interest were quality of life and parental satisfaction.
Most studies showed significant improvements in HbA1c and trends of decreased hypoglycemia. Quality of life improved in most CSII groups. Parental satisfaction with therapy was evidenced by continuation of CSII after study completion.
Current evidence indicates CSII is a safe and effective method of insulin delivery in young children. When parents are highly motivated, CSII should be offered as a mode of insulin delivery for this age group.

Effect of age of infusion site and type of rapid-acting analog on pharmacodynamic parameters of insulin boluses in youth with type 1 diabetes receiving insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19017777/),"
The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of type of insulin analog and age of insertion site on the pharmacodynamic characteristics of a standard insulin bolus in youth with type 1 diabetes receiving insulin pump therapy.
Seventeen insulin pump-treated adolescents with type 1 diabetes underwent two euglycemic clamp procedures after a 0.2 unit/kg bolus of either insulin aspart or lispro on day 1 and day 4 of insulin pump site insertion. The glucose infusion rate (GIR) required to maintain euglycemia was the primary pharmacodynamic measure.
There were no statistically significant differences in any of the pharmacodynamic parameters between aspart and lispro during day 1 and day 4. However, when the two groups were combined, time to discontinuation of exogenous glucose infusion, and time to half-maximal onset and offset of insulin action were observed significantly earlier during day 4 compared with day 1 (P = 0.03-0.0004), but the overall area under the GIR curve was similar on day 1 and day 4.
With both insulin aspart and lispro, there is an earlier peak and shorter duration of action with increasing duration of infusion site use, but overall insulin action is not affected.

The aim was to investigate triggering factors and insulin pump usage (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII) at diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Data from 1999 and 2000 were collected retrospectively from Sweden. In 1999 and 2000, 7.4 and 11.0%, respectively, of children with diabetes used CSII. One hundred and forty-two episodes of DKA (pH < 7.30) were identified in 115 children (DKA at onset not included). Their hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 10.1 +/- 2.0%, age 14.6 +/- 3.1 yr (range 1.5-19.9 yr), and diabetes duration 6.6 +/- 3.5 yr (range 0.4-17.7 yr). Fourteen persons (seven girls) had more than one episode of DKA. Reported causes of DKA were missed insulin doses (48.6%), gastroenteritis (14.1%), technical pump problems (12.7%), infection (13.4%), social problems (1.4%), unknown (5.6%), and not stated (4.2%). Alcohol was involved in eight episodes and drugs in one. Thirty of 115 patients (19 girls) used insulin pumps. The overall DKA incidence was 1.4/100 patient years in 1999 and 1.7/100 patient years in 2000. For insulin pump users, the DKA incidence was 3.2/100 patient years in 1999 and 3.6/100 patient years in 2000. HbA1c at DKA admission was lower for CSII users than patients who used injections (9.1 +/- 1.5 vs. 10.8 +/- 2.2%, p < 0.01), but pH and age did not differ. CSII had been used for 6 months (median) before the DKA episode. In conclusion, the DKA frequency in CSII users was approximately twice that of patients who used injections. Seventy-seven percent of the episodes occurred within 1 yr after CSII start. The high number of events reported to be caused by gastroenteritis is alarming because this may reflect a misinterpretation of DKA symptoms.

To evaluate interstitial glucose levels and the frequency, duration and symptoms of hypo- and hyperglycemia through the use of a continuous glucose monitoring system (GGMS) in children and adolescents with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes, and to determine whether this monitoring method is well tolerated by these patients.
Thirteen patients (4 boys) with insulin pump-treated type 1 diabetes mellitus were monitored. Age was 10.6±3.5 (range, 3.2-13.6) years, diabetes duration was 5.0±3.2 years, pump therapy duration was 12.0±4.6 months, insulin dose was 0.99 ± 0.19 U/kg/day, and last hemoglobin A1c level was 7.1% ± 0.8%. The Minimed CGMS was used for 72 hours.
A 3-year-old preschool child did not tolerate the CGMS. Interstitial glucose concentration was 187±40 mg/dl. Hypoglycemia (below 70mg/dl) accounted for 3.6% ± 5.6% of total time, while hyperglycemia (above 180 mg/dl) occurred 47.3% ± 17.4% of the time. No asymptomatic hypoglycemia episodes were detected.
Insulin pump-treated children and adolescents showed an irregular interstitial glucose level and did not achieve normoglycemia. In our patients, adrenergic symptoms of hypoglycemia were preserved and the CGMS was generally well tolerated.

Optimizing postprandial glycemia in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy: impact of glycemic index and prandial bolus type.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18509207/),"
Postprandial glycemic excursions may contribute to the development of diabetes-related complications. Meals of high and low glycemic index (GI) have distinct effects on postprandial glycemia (PPG). Insulin pump therapy offers the potential to tailor insulin delivery to meal composition; however, optimal bolus types for meals of different glycemic loads have not been defined. We sought to compare the impact of GI combined with varying prandial bolus types on PPG.
An open crossover study examining the effects of four different meal and bolus-type combinations on 3-h PPG (measured by continuous glucose-monitoring system [CGMS]) was conducted. A total of 20 young people aged 8-18 years with type 1 diabetes using insulin-pump therapy participated. Meals had equal macronutrient, energy, and fiber content and differed only in GI (low vs. high). Participants consumed meals of the same GI on consecutive days and were randomized to receive either a standard (100%) or a dual-wave (DW) (50:50% over 2 h) bolus each day. CGMS data from 10 healthy control participants established the target response to each meal.
A DW bolus before low-GI meals decreased PPG area under the curve (AUC) by up to 47% (P = 0.004) and lowered the risk of hypoglycemia for the same premeal glucose (P = 0.005) compared with standard bolus. High-GI meals resulted in significant upward PPG excursions with greater AUC (P = 0.45), regardless of bolus type.
These data support the use of a DW bolus with low GI meals to optimize PPG in patients with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy.

The use of insulin pump therapy in the pediatric age group.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18493145/),"
Diabetic children and their caregivers face the never-ceasing challenge of maintaining blood glucose levels as close as possible to the normal range so as to prevent or delay long-term micro- and macrovascular complications, to minimize the risk of severe hypoglycemic episodes, and to improve quality of life. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy represents a treatment option that can aid in achieving these goals. Granted that insulin secretor responses to physiological stimuli are complex and difficult to duplicate, CSII is the most physiological method of insulin delivery currently available, simulating the pattern of insulin secretion with a continuous adjustable 'basal' delivery and superimposed mealtime 'boluses'. CSII offers greater flexibility and more precise insulin delivery than do multiple daily injections, and thus can reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. However, when CSII was compared to multiple daily injections in randomized crossover or controlled trials in children or adolescents, generally there was no significant difference in HbA1c. This review briefly summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding the use of CSII in pediatric and adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Effects of pump treatment vs. four times daily injections were explored in children with diabetes with regard to quality of life and impact of disease as well as adverse effects and parameters of metabolic control.
An open, parallel, randomized controlled prospective comparative study lasting 14 months was completed by 38 type 1 children with diabetes (age 4-16 yr) following a 3.5-months run-in phase. Standardized quality-of-life Pediatric Quality of life Inventory (PedsQL) and impact of disease scores were obtained every 3.5 months as well as regular medical parameters. Parallel treatment group data and longitudinal within-patient data were analysed for each treatment modality.
Within-patient comparisons of the two treatment modalities showed significant improvement in PedsQL and impact scores after pump treatment. Treatment group comparisons did not show significant improvement. Pump treatment resulted in decreased symptomatic hypoglycaemia and lowered haemoglobin A1c by 0.22% after run in.
Within-patient comparison suggests that metabolic control, frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (a threefold decrease), quality of life and impact of disease scores are improved by pump treatment in comparison to regular treatment with four daily insulin injections.

Computer-assisted glucose control in critically ill patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18389221/),"
Intensive insulin therapy is associated with the risk of hypoglycemia and increased costs of material and personnel. We therefore evaluated the safety and efficiency of a computer-assisted glucose control protocol in a large population of critically ill patients.
Observational cohort study in three intensive care units (32 beds) in a 1,300-bed university teaching hospital.
All 2,800 patients admitted to the surgical, neurosurgical, and cardiothoracic units; the study period started at each ICU after implementation of Glucose Regulation for Intensive Care Patients (GRIP), a freely available computer-assisted glucose control protocol.
We analysed compliance in relation to recommended insulin pump rates and glucose measurement frequency. Patients were on GRIP-ordered pump rates 97% of time. Median measurement time was 5min late (IQR 20min early to 34 min late). Hypoglycemia was uncommon (7% of patients for mild hypoglycemia, < 3.5mmol/l; 0.86% for severe hypoglycemia, < 2.2 mmol/l). Our predefined target range (4.0-7.5 mmol/l) was reached after a median of 5.6 h (IQR 0.2-11.8) and maintained for 89% (70-100%) of the remaining stay at the ICU. The number of measurements needed was 5.9 (4.8-7.3) per patient per day. In-hospital mortality was 10.1%.
Our computer-assisted glucose control protocol provides safe and efficient glucose regulation in routine intensive care practice. A low rate of hypoglycemic episodes was achieved with a considerably lower number of glucose measurements than used in most other schemes.

Insulin-pump use in everyday practice: data from an exhaustive regional registry in France.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18289909/),"
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) under real-life conditions among all patients treated with CSII in the south of Paris.
The 42 diabetologists practising in the region enrolled all patients treated with CSII or admitted for CSII initiation. During the study visit, the data for pump use and clinical results were recorded.
Data were obtained for 424 patients, mean age 44.2+/-15.6 years, disease duration 18.7+/-10.6 years, including 339 treated with CSII for longer than three months (mean duration: 3.5+/-3.5 years; range: 3-258 months). Most of the patients (N=285, 84.8%) had type 1 diabetes; 44 (13.1%) had type 2 diabetes. In patients treated for more than three months, HbA1c decreased significantly between CSII initiation (9.1+/-1.9%) and the study visit (7.8+/-1.4%; P<0.0001). Patients with HbA1c >9%, using the pump, experienced a significant 0.9% improvement in their HbA1c levels with CSII versus multiple daily injections (P=0.001). The number of episodes of moderate hypoglycaemia was 2.7+/-2.5 per patient per week; of severe hypoglycaemia, 0.34 per patient per year and of ketoacidosis, 0.11 per patient per year. Factors significantly associated with HbA1c levels included amount of physical activity, pregnancy, HbA1c at CSII initiation and number of glucose self-determinations. Those associated with the number of moderate hypoglycaemia episodes were basal rate number, female gender and HbA1c level. HbA1c was negatively correlated with moderate hypoglycaemia (P<0.001), but not with severe hypoglycaemia.
This 'pump' registry establishes the effectiveness of CSII in everyday practice, yet underscores the risks of severe hypoglycaemia and ketosis episodes. It could help diabetologists to improve patient training programmes and follow-up.

Fully automated closed-loop insulin delivery versus semiautomated hybrid control in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes using an artificial pancreas.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18252903/),"
The most promising beta-cell replacement therapy for children with type 1 diabetes is a closed-loop artificial pancreas incorporating continuous glucose sensors and insulin pumps. The Medtronic MiniMed external physiological insulin delivery (ePID) system combines an external pump and sensor with a variable insulin infusion rate algorithm designed to emulate the physiological characteristics of the beta-cell. However, delays in insulin absorption associated with the subcutaneous route of delivery inevitably lead to large postprandial glucose excursions.
We studied the feasibility of the Medtronic ePID system in youth with type 1 diabetes and hypothesized that small manual premeal ""priming"" boluses would reduce postprandial excursions during closed-loop control. Seventeen adolescents (aged 15.9 +/- 1.6 years; A1C 7.1 +/- 0.8%) underwent 34 h of closed-loop control; 8 with full closed-loop (FCL) control and 9 with hybrid closed-loop (HCL) control (premeal priming bolus).
Mean glucose levels were 135 +/- 45 mg/dl in the HCL group versus 141 +/- 55 mg/dl in the FCL group (P = 0.09); daytime glucose levels averaged 149 +/- 47 mg/dl in the HCL group versus 159 +/- 59 mg/dl in the FCL group (P = 0.03). Peak postprandial glucose levels averaged 194 +/- 47 mg/dl in the HCL group versus 226 +/- 51 mg/dl in the FCL group (P = 0.04). Nighttime control was similar in both groups (111 +/- 27 vs. 112 +/- 28 mg/dl).
Closed-loop glucose control using an external sensor and insulin pump provides a means to achieve near-normal glucose concentrations in youth with type 1 diabetes during the overnight period. The addition of small manual priming bolus doses of insulin, given 15 min before meals, improves postprandial glycemic excursions.

Use of CoZmonitor in youth with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18221430/),"
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of directly integrating self-monitoring blood glucose (BG) information with insulin pump therapy on overall glycemic control.
In this randomized trial, 34 youth with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy were trained on the use of the Deltec Cozmo Insulin Pump. Seventeen were randomized to use the CoZmonitor Blood Glucose Module, a device that attaches to the back of the pump using FreeStyle technology to perform BG tests which read directly on the pump screen. The remaining 17 (control group) used a FreeStyle Flash meter, a stand-alone BG meter, for their BG testing. At baseline, 3 and 6 months, the subjects filled out a questionnaire, had a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test, and had pumps and meters downloaded.
After 3 months of study, there were no changes in mean HbA1c (+/- SD) values for the experimental (8.7 +/- 1.1 to 8.6 +/- 1.1) or the control groups (9.1 +/- 1.4 to 9.2 +/- 1.5). There were also no significant differences in HbA1c values after 6 months. The average number of BG tests per day did not change significantly in either group during the study. After 3 and 6 months, the experimental group rated satisfaction with the use of the CoZmonitor at 4.4 and 3.8 (respectively) on a five-point Likert scale, with 5 being the most satisfied.
Although significant changes in HbA1c values or the number of BG tests were not found, use of the BG module had a positive level of satisfaction.

Nutritional management of children and adolescents on insulin pump therapy - a survey of Australian Practice.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18221428/),"
The aims of the survey were to review nutritional care provided to children on insulin pump therapy (IPT) and to identify areas of consensus in medical nutrition therapy. Interventions were compared with existing evidence for best practice.
A questionnaire was sent to Dieticians in tertiary pediatric diabetes centers in Australia. Data were gathered on clinic demographics, reasons for commencement of pump therapy, and time spent in medical nutrition therapy. Details of nutrition education strategies were identified. Outcomes from nutrition interventions were reported.
A 100% response rate was achieved (n = 12). A number of nutrition therapy interventions were provided to children on IPT. These included carbohydrate counting, glycemic index (GI), and carbohydrate exchanges. At most centers, nutrition education involved teaching dose adjustment for meals based on the carbohydrate content of the meal with estimations to within 5 g. All centers taught GI. The format of nutrition education, including number and length of consults, varied greatly between centers. Only one center had developed nutrition guidelines for managing insulin pump patients.
Most pediatric diabetes centers in Australia did not follow nutrition guidelines for the management of children on IPT. There were inconsistencies in the number and length of nutrition consultations provided. Some strategies employed in nutrition education were not supported by existing guidelines for best practice. Differences between centers highlighted gaps in the evidence for nutrition therapy interventions in children on pumps.

Quantifying the impact of a short-interval interruption of insulin-pump infusion sets on glycemic excursions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18056889/),"
This prospective, open-label study was designed to measure the impact of short-term infusion-set disconnects on glucose levels. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy allows for uninterrupted delivery of insulin. Patients disconnect their insulin pumps from their infusion sets when showering, swimming, exercising, or during intimate moments. Interrupting insulin infusion results in cessation of basal insulin delivery. Nineteen subjects with type 1 diabetes were studied on two separate in-clinic days. One hour after arriving at the clinic in a fasting state, subjects either temporarily disconnected their infusion sets from their pumps, interrupting basal insulin infusion for 30 min, or, on a separate day, changed their infusion sets. Glucose levels were monitored for an additional 4 h on both occasions. Changing infusion sets did not affect short-term glucose control. However, the 30-min interruption of basal insulin infusion resulted in significant glucose elevation; approximately 1 mg/dl for each minute basal insulin infusion was interrupted.

Fetal growth in women managed with insulin pump therapy compared to conventional insulin.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18006209/),"
Fetal hyperinsulinaemia secondary to maternal hyperglycaemia is considered to be the driving force behind excessive fetal growth. We hypothesised that insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, CSII) would improve maternal glycaemic control and normalise fetal growth parameters. To this end, this study compares maternal glycaemic control and fetal growth of women receiving insulin pump therapy with those receiving conventional insulin therapy.
Prospective non-randomised study of 42 women with pre-existing diabetes attending a joint obstetric diabetic clinic. Each woman was offered the choice of commencing insulin pump therapy or remaining on a conventional insulin regime. Estimated fetal weight and fetal growth velocity were calculated from routinely collected third trimester ultrasound biometry and expressed as standard deviation (Z) scores.
Eighteen women commenced insulin pump therapy. There was no difference in pre-conception glycosylated haemoglobin A1c concentrations (HbA1c) between pump and conventional therapy groups (mean HbA1c 7.62 versus 8.01; p=0.49) or third trimester glycaemic control (mean HbA1c 6.63 versus 6.44; p=0.51). Women using pump therapy had similar mean growth velocity Z scores (1.5 versus 1.36; p=0.83), similar mean estimated fetal weight Z scores prior to delivery (2.80 versus 2.16; p=0.16) and similar mean birthweight Z scores (2.09 versus 2.00; p=0.86) compared to women using conventional insulin therapy.
This small, non-randomised study suggests that the use of insulin pump therapy offers no benefit in terms of normalising fetal growth velocity, fetal size, birthweight or improving maternal glycaemic control compared to conventional insulin therapy.

Pediatric quality of life in transitioning to the insulin pump: does prior regimen make a difference?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17585009/),"
A shift in conventional diabetes management has graduated to basal (glargine) and bolus (rapid-acting analogue) therapy via multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is considered the most intensive type of diabetes management, and before transitioning, consideration of regimen benefits should include lifestyle and quality-of-life issues in addition to medical benefits. Short-term and long-term changes in children's quality of life, as a function of their pre-CSII diabetes regimen, was assessed in 52 children before their transition to CSII from a conventional or multiple daily injection regimen. Results demonstrated significant improvement in quality of life only for those children transitioning to CSII from conventional vs multiple daily injection regimens; results were maintained at 6 months following pump initiation. Quality of life is an important consideration as children transition from more traditional to intensive regimens, and CSII devices may not necessarily improve satisfaction with diabetes control in all pediatric patients. Risks and benefits of both intensive regimens should be discussed before making the transition.

In the future, the delivery of drugs using telemetric techniques will become more and more important. In the present investigations an experimental insulin pump has been developed which is remote-controlled via a computer program and the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The commands for pump control are transferred in encrypted form via the Short Message Service (SMS). The pump can be programmed in advance for a time period of 24 h. An integrated sensor gives exact information about the number of steps executed by the stepping motor which is controlling the drug release. Model experiments show that there is almost no delay between sending the control SMS and execution of the commands by the pump.

Systematic literature review: quality of life associated with insulin pump use in Type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17367304/),"
To review systematically the published literature addressing whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) provides any quality of life benefits to people with Type 1 diabetes.
Electronic databases and published references were searched and a consultation with two professional groups was undertaken to identify relevant studies published up to July 2005. A multistep selection process was then undertaken to identify those articles which met the specific selection criteria, which were then critically reviewed.
Eighty-four potential relevant articles were identified from examination of titles and abstracts published during the specified time frame. Of these, 28 articles were retrieved in full text, of which 17 fulfilled the specific criteria for inclusion. Mixed results emerged from existing literature. Of the five randomized controlled trials, three reported mixed results, with one study reporting quality of life benefits and one reporting no evidence of quality of life benefits.
There is conflicting evidence reported in the various studies on the quality of life benefits of CSII in Type 1 diabetes. Existing research is flawed, making a judgement about the quality of life benefits of insulin pump use difficult. There is no strong evidence against quality of life benefits associated with CSII or otherwise, with poor methodology and inconsistent assessment of quality of life clouding the issue. The lack of reported benefit is probably a function of this rather than pump therapy not offering any quality of life benefits.

To report the effect of insulin pump therapy on glycaemic control and on hypoglycaemia and ketosis rates in Type 1 diabetic patients.
A retrospective audit of the management of patients with Type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy at the Waikato Diabetes Service (Hamilton, New Zealand) between September 1997 and December 2004.
The data of 105 patients currently on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) at the time of data collection were examined. CSII use had occurred for a mean of 3.0+/-2.6 years. HbA1c% improved significantly from 8.9+/-1.3% to 7.9+/-1.0% (P<0.001) at 3 months and 7.9+/-0.95% (P<0.001) at 6 months post CSII. This reduction was maintained after 1, 2, and 3 years and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). In the adolescent subgroup (n=27) we observed a similar significant reduction in HbA1c% that was maintained after 1 year of pump therapy. The incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was reduced from 0.75 cases per patient-year during multiple daily injection (MDI) pre-pump to 0.05 cases per patient-year during CSII (P<0.001). In some cases hypoglycaemia awareness was restored. There was no evidence to suggest increased tendency for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with continuing use of insulin pumps. Conclusion Our experience showed that insulin pump therapy was effective and safe for both adults and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes. The reduction in HbA1c% was both statistically and clinically highly significant. Wider usage of this technology in New Zealand is warranted.

Predictors of glycemic control on insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type I diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16704885/),"
To determine variables predictive of glycemic control in a large population of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
Charts of patients on CSII for > or =1 year were reviewed. ""Good"" control was a priori defined as HbA1c < or =9% in patients under 12 years of age, and < or =8% in patients over 12 years.
Ninety-three patients were identified (57 girls and 36 boys). Their mean age at pump start was 11.6+/-3.1 years with duration of diabetes of 4.7+/-3.1 years. Average time on pump therapy was 2.4+/-0.8 years. HbA1C decreased from 8.7+/-0.9% prior to pump therapy to 8.3+/-0.6% while on CSII (p < 0.01). Despite analysis of a large number of possible predictors, only number of basal rates (4.4 versus 3.4) and younger age (10.0 years versus 13.1 years) correlated with good control.
Only younger age and use of more basal rates were predictive of good diabetes control in children using CSII. Decisions regarding which pediatric patients are most appropriate for CSII must continue to be individualized.

Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis among adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump users and non-users.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33318067/),"
Insulin pumps are increasingly being used as a method of insulin delivery in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of T1DM. This study aims to identify the causes of DKA in patients with T1DM on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and to compare these with patients with T1DM on multiple daily insulin injections (MDIIs).
This is a prospective observational study between January and June 2019 at the Cleveland Clinic Fairview Hospital. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were obtained from chart review. A questionnaire to explore additional clinical data relating to DKA was administered, with additional items for patients on the insulin pump.
Seventy-four patients were admitted with a diagnosis of DKA between the period of January and June 2019. Of these, 45 met the inclusion criteria and 43 consented. These were divided into two groups: group 1 included patients on MDII and group 2 included CSII. Overall, the most common precipitating factor for developing DKA was insulin non-adherence, seen in 51.2% of the cases. The most common cause of DKA in group 2 was pump/tubing related to 55% of the cases.
Despite non-adherence being common in both CSII and MDII, a combination of social factors, education and insulin pump malfunction, such as pump/tubing problems, might be playing a pivotal role in DKA etiology in young adults with T1DM, especially in CSII users. Continued education on pump use may reduce the rate of DKA in pump users.

A multi-center randomized controlled trial of the LenoMed ATA-I-1-0 insulin pump for the intensive treatment of diabetic patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33313230/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is an effective method for managing diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the LenoMed ATA-I-1-0 insulin pump for the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, compared to the Medtronic MMT-712 insulin pump.
A total of 120 subjects with diabetes needing insulin treatment were recruited, and 104 completed the trial. The intervention and control group used the LenoMed and Medtronic insulin pump, respectively. The primary outcome was a reduction in fasting plasma glucose. Secondary outcomes included blood glucose control at 7 time points (before and after each meal, and before sleep), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels at 1 time point, and accuracy and safety of the pumps.
In the per protocol set of 104 subjects, a significant drop in fasting plasma glucose levels was observed for 98.0% subjects in the intervention group and 92.7% in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference between groups [5.23%; 95% confidence interval (CI): -2.69% -13.2%]. Compared to baseline, levels of blood glucose and HbA1c dropped (P<0.001) at a similar magnitude in both groups. The accuracy and alarm effectiveness was 100%. No adverse event or severe adverse event related to the medication occurred in the study.
The novel injection equipment, the LenoMed ATA-I-1-0 insulin pump, demonstrated efficacy and a good safety profile, and was not inferior to the widely used Medtronic MMT-712 insulin pump. Thus, our study suggests that the LenoMed ATA-I-1-0 insulin pump can be widely used in clinical practice.

Data-Driven Insights on Behavioral Factors that Affect Diabetes Management.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33019237/),"
The prevalence of personal health data from wearable devices enables new opportunities to understand the impact of behavioral factors on health. Unlike consumer devices that are often auxiliary, such as Fitbit and Garmin, wearable medical devices like continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices and insulin pumps are becoming critical in diabetes care to minimize the occurrence of adverse glycemic events. Joint analysis of CGM and insulin pump data can provide unparalleled insights on how to modify treatment regimen to improve diabetes management outcomes. In this paper, we employ a data-driven approach to study the relationship between key behavioral factors and proximal diabetic management indicators. Our dataset includes an average of 161 days of time-matched CGM and insulin pump data from 34 subjects with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). By employing hypothesis testing and association mining, we observe that smaller meals and insulin doses are associated with better glycemic outcomes compared to larger meals and insulin doses. Meanwhile, the occurrence of interrupted sleep is associated with poorer glycemic outcomes. This paper introduces a method for inferring disrupted sleep from wearable diabetes-device data and provides a baseline for future research on sleep quality and diabetes. This work also provides insights for development of decision-support tools for improving short- and long-term outcomes in diabetes care.

Diabetes devices, like insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), capture and store patient adherence and utilization data that can be retrieved or downloaded providing objective information on self-management behaviors; yet, diabetes device data remain underutilized in research.
The aim of the study was to examine the usability and feasibility of personal diabetes device data collected using a clinical download platform retooled for research purposes.
Investigators evaluated the feasibility of raw diabetes device data collection. One hundred eight preteens and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes and their parents provided consent/assent.
Data were successfully collected from the diabetes devices (insulin pumps and CGM) of 97 youth using a clinical download software adapted for research, including data from all three commercially available CGM systems and insulin pumps brands, which contained all current and previous models of each insulin pump brand. The time required to download, mode of connection, and process varied significantly between brands. Despite the use of an agnostic download software, some outdated device brands and cloud-based CGM data were unsupported during data collection. Within the download software, dummy clinical accounts were created for each study participant, which were then linked back to a master study account for data retrieval. Raw device data were extracted into seven to eight Excel files per participant, which were then used to develop aggregate daily measures.
Our analysis is the first of its kind to examine the feasibility of raw diabetes device data using a clinical download software. The investigators highlight issues encountered throughout the research process, along with mitigating strategies to inform future inquiry.
This study demonstrates the feasibility of raw data collection, from a wide variety of insulin pump and CGM brands, through the retooling of a clinical download software.

People with type 1 diabetes who use continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII, or insulin pump therapy) often remove their pump before extended periods of exercise, but this approach might result in reduced glycaemic control and increased risk of hyperglycaemia and ketogenesis. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of a hybrid approach, in which basal insulin delivery was divided between CSII and a daily injection of insulin degludec.
In this single-centre, open-label, proof-of-concept, randomised crossover trial done at the LMC Diabetes & Endocrinology research centre, we recruited physically active and aerobically fit participants aged 18 years or older with type 1 diabetes who were using CSII. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a computer-generated sequence to one of two sequences of either usual CSII, involving the continuation of the participant's usual CSII regimen, followed by crossover to hybrid CSII, in which the delivery of the participant's usual daily basal insulin dose was split (50% delivered by CSII and 50% delivered by a once-daily morning injection of 100 U/mL insulin degludec), or the opposite sequence (ie, hybrid CSII followed by crossover to usual CSII). Treatment was not masked to the investigators or participants. For each intervention, participants completed a moderate-intensity and a high-intensity in-clinic exercise session in the first week, followed by four high-intensity and two moderate-intensity home-based exercise sessions in the subsequent 3 weeks. Insulin pumps were suspended or disconnected 60 min before exercise and reconnected immediately after exercise during both treatment regimens. The coprimary outcomes were: (1) time spent in the target control range of 4·0-10·0 mmol/L blood glucose after high-intensity exercise, and (2) time spent in target control range of 4·0-10·0 mmol/L blood glucose after moderate-intensity exercise, measured by continuous glucose monitoring in the 6-h period from the start of the high-intensity and moderate-intensity in-clinic exercise sessions. Outcomes were assessed in a modified intention-to-treat population that included all participants who started both intervention phases and completed all of the in-clinic exercise visits. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03838783, and is complete.
Between May 15, 2018, and March 5, 2019, we assessed 43 patients for eligibility, of whom 31 were randomly assigned to receive the usual CSII regimen (n=14) or hybrid CSII regimen (n=17) in the first phase (before crossover). The analysis population consisted of 24 participants who completed both study phases. Compared with the usual CSII regimen, participants on the hybrid CSII regimen had a significantly longer time in blood glucose range of 4-10 mmol/L during the 6-h period from the start of both moderate-intensity (mean difference 86 min [95% CI 61-147], p=0·005; percentage time in range 64% [SD 35] vs 40% [35]) and high-intensity in-clinic exercise session (60 min [11-109], p=0·01; 66% [32] vs 50% [27]). Participants on the hybrid CSII regimen also showed a higher time in blood glucose range of 4-10 mmol/L during home-based exercise sessions (mean difference 23 min [95% CI -1 to 46], p=0·055), with significantly lower time spent in hyperglycaemia than participants on the usual CSII regimen (mean difference 25 min [2-48], p=0·04). These exploratory outcomes also showed no significant difference in the amount of time spent in hypoglycaemia, nor the number of hypoglycaemic events, between the two interventions. There were three study-related adverse events reported with the usual CSII regimen (two hypotension events and one nausea event) and four with the hybrid CSII regimen (two hypotension events and two nausea events).
A hybrid regimen of injected insulin degludec and CSII (with pump removal during exercise) appears to be safe and effective in adults with type 1 diabetes who exercise regularly. This approach could offer improved glycaemic control immediately after exercise and should be further assessed in a larger-scale randomised trial.

Insulin Pump,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32310421/),"
Diabetes mellitus affects over 34 million people in the United States, and the number is growing. Of those, a subset is dependent on insulin therapy for blood glucose control, which can delay the onset and slow progression of diabetes-associated complications, including retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy.[1] Currently, there are two regimens for insulin delivery: multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, also known as insulin pump therapy. With technological advances, reduction in costs, and data from randomized clinical trials, a growing population of patients are using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. For medical professionals, general knowledge of how the medical device functions and indications for removal of the device can help improve patient care and outcomes.[2]

Neonatal hyperglycemia in a preterm infant managed with a subcutaneous insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32280964/),"
Successful use of a subcutaneous insulin pump to administer regular insulin to a preterm infant with neonatal hyperglycemia is described.
A 520-g female infant born at 23 weeks' gestational age via caesarian section was noted to have elevated blood glucose concentrations ranging up to 180 mg/dL (in SI units, 10 mmol/L) on day of life (DOL) 3 and peaking on DOL 9 at 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) despite conservative glucose infusion rates. Continuous infusion of regular insulin was begun on DOL 8 and continued through DOL 44, with an average insulin infusion rate of 0.08 units/kg/h. The patient experienced blood glucose concentration lability due to multiple factors, resulting in the need for frequent and routine blood glucose concentration monitoring to minimize hypoglycemia events. On DOL 44, a subcutaneous insulin pump was placed and used to provide diluted regular insulin (25 units/mL). After 1 week, the patient's blood glucose concentration normalized, which led to a reduction in the frequency of glucose monitoring. After 3 weeks, insulin pump use was discontinued. The patient remained euglycemic thereafter.
The use of an insulin pump resulted in decreased blood glucose checks, discontinuation of central line access, and overall better patient care.

HbA1c Levels in Type 1 Diabetes from Early Childhood to Older Adults: A Deeper Dive into the Influence of Technology and Socioeconomic Status on HbA1c in the T1D Exchange Clinic Registry Findings.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31905008/),"

Objective:
 The T1D Exchange Clinic Registry figure of HbA1c levels according to age has become a classic picture of how average HbA1c varies from childhood to elderly. To further assess the course of HbA1c across the life span in T1D, we created similar figures stratified by device use and socioeconomic status (SES). 
Methods:
 Mean HbA1c was plotted versus age for 21,253 T1D Exchange Clinic Registry participants with an HbA1c measurement between January 1, 2016 and March 31, 2018 according to device use, race/ethnicity, and measures of SES. 
Results:
 Across the age range from childhood to elderly, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use without an insulin pump had better average HbA1c than pump without CGM; and among CGM users, pump and injection users had similar HbA1c levels. Any device use (pump or CGM) was associated with better HbA1c levels than no device use across the age range. Lower SES and African American race were associated with higher HbA1c across the age range. Across all device use, SES, and race/ethnicity factors, average HbA1c levels were highest in adolescents and young adults. 
Conclusion:
 Although the plot of average HbA1c from early childhood to elderly shifts according to device use and SES factors, the shape of the plots remains reasonably constant with highest HbA1c levels in adolescents and young adults. These findings emphasize the importance of targeting adolescence and early adulthood as the ages with the greatest need for improving diabetes management irrespective of device use and SES.

Insulin Pump Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31833871/),"
Advances in pump technology have increased the popularity of this treatment modality among patients with type 1 diabetes and recently also among patients with type 2 diabetes.
Four decades after the incorporation of the insulin pump in clinical use, questions regarding its efficacy, occurrence rate of short-term complications as hypoglycemia and diabetes ketoacidosis, timing of pump initiation, and selected populations for use remain unanswered.
A review of the literature was performed using the PubMed database to identify all articles published up till December 2018, with the search terms including insulin pump therapy/continuous subcutaneous insulin delivery. The Cochrane database was searched for meta-analysis evaluating controlled randomized trials. Consensuses guidelines published by the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes, American Diabetes Association, and Advanced Technologies and Treatments for Diabetes year books were additionally reviewed for relevant cited articles.
Insulin pump therapy offers flexible management of diabetes. It enables adjustment of basal insulin to daily requirements and circadian needs, offers more precise treatment for meals and physical activity, and, when integrated with continuous glucose monitoring, allows glucose responsive insulin delivery. The ability to download and transmit data for analysis allow for treatment optimization. Newer pumps are simple to operate and increase user experience. Studies support the efficacy of pump therapy in improving glycemic control and reducing the occurrence of hypoglycemia without increasing episodes of diabetes ketoacidosis. They also improve quality of life. Recent evidence suggests a role for pump therapy in reducing microvascular and macrovascular diabetes-related complications.
Insulin pump therapy appears to be effective and safe in people with T1D regardless of age. Future advancements will include incorporation of closed loop and various decision support systems to aid and improve metabolic control and quality of life.

Air occlusion in insulin pumps of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31812947/),"
Background Insulin pumps are a frequently used technology among youth with type 1 diabetes. Air bubbles within insulin pump tubing are common, preventing insulin delivery and increasing the risk of large glycemic excursions and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We sought to determine the prevalence of air bubbles in insulin pump tubing and identify factors associated with clinically significant air bubbles. Methods Fifty-three subjects were recruited over 65 office visits. The insulin pump tubing was visualized, and any air bubbles were measured by length. The length of air bubbles was then converted to time without insulin at the lowest basal rate. Generalized linear model (GLM) was used to determine the associations between air bubble size and other variables. Results Of the 65 encounters, 45 had air bubbles in the tubing. Five (5/65 = 7.7%) encounters had a time without insulin of more than 60 min. Air bubble size was inversely correlated with time since infusion set change (p < 0.001), and directly correlated with age of the subject (p = 0.049). Conclusions Significantly more air bubbles were found in the tubing of insulin pumps soon after infusion set change and with older subjects, suggesting a relationship with the technique of filling the insulin cartridge and priming the tubing.

Future technology-enabled care for diabetes and hyperglycemia in the hospital setting.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31558981/),"
Patients with diabetes are increasingly common in hospital settings where optimal glycemic control remains challenging. Inpatient technology-enabled support systems are being designed, adapted and evaluated to meet this challenge. Insulin pump use, increasingly common in outpatients, has been shown to be safe among select inpatients. Dedicated pump protocols and provider training are needed to optimize pump use in the hospital. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has been shown to be comparable to usual care for blood glucose surveillance in intensive care unit (ICU) settings but data on cost effectiveness is lacking. CGM use in non-ICU settings remains investigational and patient use of home CGM in inpatient settings is not recommended due to safety concerns. Compared to unstructured insulin prescription, a continuum of effective electronic medical record-based support for insulin prescription exists from passive order sets to clinical decision support to fully automated electronic Glycemic Management Systems. Relative efficacy and cost among these systems remains unanswered. An array of novel platforms are being evaluated to engage patients in technology-enabled diabetes education in the hospital. These hold tremendous promise in affording universal access to hospitalized patients with diabetes to effective self-management education and its attendant short/long term clinical benefits.

Assessment of selected food intake frequency in patients with type 1 diabetes treated with personal insulin pumps,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31515985/),"
It has been established that in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM), regardless of the insulin therapy model used, diet and proper eating habits are still important in the treatment of the disease. The dietary intervention in these patients is aimed at maintaining proper body weight, obtaining target fasting and post meal blood glucose levels, optimizing lipid profiles.
The aim of the study was to assess dietary habits in a homogeneous group of adults with T1DM treated with personal insulin pumps.
The study included 141 adult patients (57% women) with type 1 diabetes treated with personal insulin pumps. The surveyed population was characterized by an average age of 25.8 ± 6.2 years, an average duration of diabetes 13.9 ± 6.9 years, and treatment with a personal pump for 8.2 ± 4.1 years and mean BMI 23.0 ± 2.8 g/m2. All were dwellers of south-eastern Poland. The validated KomPAN questionnaire was used to assess the frequency of consumption of individual food products.
The mean percentage of HbA1c in the study group was 7.3% [56 mmol/mol]. The mean total cholesterol level was 4.4 mmol/l, HDL - 1.7 mmol/l, LDL - 2.3 mmol/l and triglycerides - 0.8 mmol/l. In the multivariate regression model, no correlation was found between dietary quality parameters and metabolic compensation measured with HbA1c or lipidogram and the place of residence (village, small town, big city). However, there were differences in the quality of the diet depending on the sex. Women were characterized by higher index of a healthy diet (pHDI-10) (26.3 vs 21.4, p=0.005) and lower index of unhealthy diet (nHDI-14) (13.3 vs 18.6, p <0.001) than men.
The results of this study clearly suggest, that despite good metabolic control, patients require more education on the choice of healthy product groups.

Kalman Filter-Based Novel Methodology to Assess Insulin Pump Accuracy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31335164/),"

Background:
 Insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) system is a widely adopted contemporary treatment for type 1 diabetes and is a major component of an artificial pancreas (AP). CSII accuracy is essential for glycemic control and to-date such metric has not been given sufficient study, especially at the range of the lowest basal rate. The gold-standard assessment method IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) 60601-2-24 has some limitations. Our study presents a new accurate and reactive method for CSII system evaluation based on direct flow measurement. 
Materials and Methods:
 A leading-edge assessment method based on a double measurement approach utilizing a direct mass flow meter and a time-stamped microgravimetric bench test was combined with a Bayesian-based mathematical filter (Kalman). The performance of this new method was evaluated while assessing the delivery precision of an off-the-shelf insulin pump at several basal rates. The proposed methodology offers a double reading-volume and flow rate-which provides direct instantaneous flow rate. CSII dose errors were evaluated using mean absolute relative dispersion (MARD) at different time intervals windows over the whole test. 
Results:
 The metrological aspect of the measurements and filtering performance were consistent. CSII precision is shown to be different in terms of the flow rate value: MARD15min (2 UI/h) = 12.7%, MARD15min (0.5 UI/h) = 20.4%, and MARD15min (0.1 UI/h) = 65.0%. MARD240min (2 UI/h) = 8.1%, (0.5 UI/h), MARD240min (0.5 UI/h) = 18.8%, and MARD240min (0.1 UI/h) = 18.4%. Instantaneous flow rate results highlight an irregular stroke-based delivery. 
Conclusion:
 This new method to assess insulin pump administration has been validated and highlights the current imprecision in insulin delivery, especially for the lowest basal rate, which is mainly used in pediatric cases and AP system delivery. This leading-edge method should be used to precisely compare several CSII performances in those contexts.

Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan among older children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes in Kuwait.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31318694/),"
Background To evaluate the safety of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan among children and adolescent with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods A retrospective cohort study of 50 children and adolescents with T1D whose mean age was 12.7 ± 2.1 years was conducted. Twenty-seven patients (54%) were on multiple daily injections (MDI) insulin regimen and 23 (46%) were on insulin pump therapy. Before fasting for Ramadan, children and their families were evaluated and educated about diabetes management during Ramadan. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, number of days fasted, hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia episodes, and emergency hospital visits were collected and analyzed after completing the month. Participants were compared according to the insulin treatment regimen and their glycemic control level before Ramadan. Results The children were able to fast 20 ± 9.9 days of Ramadan, and the most common cause for breaking the fast was mild hypoglycemia (7.8% among all cases). There was no significant difference between the two insulin regimen groups in breaking fast days, frequency of hypo- or hyperglycemia, weight and HbA1c changes post Ramadan. Patients with HbA1c ≤ 8.5% were able to fast more days during Ramadan with significantly less-frequent hypoglycemic attacks as compared to patients with HbA1c > 8.5 (1.2 ± 1.5 vs. 3.3 ± 2.9 days of hypoglycemia, p = 0.01, respectively). Conclusions Fasting for children with T1D above the age of 10 years is feasible and safe in both pump and non-pump users, and well-controlled patients are less likely to develop complications. Education of the families and their children before Ramadan, along with intensive monitoring of fasting children during the month are crucial.

Insulin Pump Combined with Flash Glucose Monitoring: A Therapeutic Option to Improve Glycemic Control in Severely Nonadherent Patients with Type 1 Diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31265349/),"
Some patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) are severely noncompliant; they rarely perform self-blood glucose measures and miss insulin injections. Their HbA1c is far above the target rate. Current guidelines do not recommend starting treatment with an insulin pump (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) for these persons. The aim of this study was to determine whether a CSII associated with a flash glucose monitoring (FGM) device could reduce HbA1c without increasing the risk of acute events, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and severe hypoglycemia (SH), in these patients. We conducted a 6-month nonrandomized, pilot prospective study. Patients with T1D on multiple daily injections who performed less than two self-blood glucose tests/day and had an HbA1c >9% were equipped with CSII and an FGM device. The primary composite endpoint was defined by a change in HbA1c ≥1% without any episode of DKA or SH during 6 months. Change in mean HbA1c, weight, treatment satisfaction, frequency of minor hypoglycemia, and ketoacidosis were secondary endpoints. Nineteen adults were included. Median (Q1-Q3) HbA1c at baseline was 10.8 (10.3-13.0), 14 participants did not perform any self-monitoring and 5 performed maximum two tests daily. Twelve participants (63%) (95% confidence interval 41%-81%) met the primary composite endpoint. Seventeen patients completed the study. HbA1c decreased by 2% (1.0-3.3) (P < 0.001), and satisfaction with treatment significantly improved. Three participants experienced SH and one a DKA, versus, respectively, five and eight in the year preceding the study. Participants scanned the sensor 4 (3-6) times per day and injected 3 (2.7-4.1) boluses per day. Weight increased significantly. An association of an insulin pump with an FGM device can be an effective and safe therapeutic option in severely nonadherent and noncompliant patients with high HbA1c.

Breaking Socioeconomic Barriers in Diabetes Technologies: Outcomes of a Pilot Insulin Pump Programme for the Underprivileged in Rural India.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31161111/),"
To assess whether the socioeconomic and stereotypical barriers for the adoption of advanced diabetes technologies can be overcome in the underprivileged children and their families in India, predominantly from the rural areas, by providing insulin pump therapy (CSII) to deserving patients.
All patients were selected from the type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) database of the Kovai Medical Center and Hospital, Coimbatore. Sixteen people with type 1 diabetes (PWD) were chosen due to poor control or an urgent situation like pregnancy or renal failure. Demographic data along with variables such as age, sex, time of diagnosis of T1DM, duration of CSII therapy, total daily insulin dose, hypoglycaemias, hospitalisations, glycosylated haemoglobin pre- and post-pump were collected. The glycosylated haemoglobin values were collected at 3, 6 and 12 months, post-CSII hypoglycaemia was defined as self-reported hypoglycaemia by the patient.
During 12 month follow-up, all 16 PWD were using the insulin pump with significant reductions in HbA1c from 11.4% at baseline to 8.0% (P < 0.001) and 7.6% at the end of 3 and 6 months, respectively.
Our results indicate that the CSII therapy without prejudice can lead to significant reductions in glycaemic control, hospitalisations and quality of life. This pilot work will help us lobby government policy makers to ensure policy changes that help the underprivileged with T1DM in India.

To review the literature on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily injections (MDI) to help the family of a 13-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes mellitus on MDI choose the best insulin delivery method for her to improve her glycaemic control. A literature search was performed to assess available evidence regarding CSII use versus MDI use for glycaemic control. We identified 15 relevant articles and present these, with a detailed analysis of a multicentre randomised controlled trial by Mueller-Godeffroy et al. Although CSII use demonstrated a reduction in HbA1c (-0.18 to -0.7%) in some studies compared to MDI, this finding was not consistent across all studies. Mueller-Godeffroy et al. did not find a statistically significant different in HbA1c between CSII and MDI patients; however, additional benefits of insulin pump therapy, including improved diabetes-related quality of life and reduced care giver burden, were reported. Further high-quality randomised controlled trials and long-term data are required to assess the benefits of CSII over MDI and the longevity of these methods.

Insulin pump therapy: education and its goals.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31091943/),"
Insulin pump therapy represents nowadays the way of insulin administration most similar to the physiological insulin secretion. This form of intensified insulin regime is used mostly (but not exclusively) in type 1 diabetes patients. Insulin pump therapy can be efficiently combined with continuous glucose monitoring. Even there are available insulin pumps which can serve as continuous glucose monitoring signal receiver themselves and are capable to stop automatically basal insulin infusion to prevent hypoglycemia. By this technological combination it is possible to reach near normoglycemia without increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia. In the Czech Republic this therapy is covered by insurance when defined indication criteria are fulfilled. To reach this therapy full potential the patient as well as the professionals must be trained properly to know all technical aspects of this therapy as well as it is necessary to gain further knowledge. Particularly important is knowledge on food nutrition content and on the glycemic effect of different meals. All these factors are discussed in details in the paper.

Perceptions in Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus with or Without the Use of Insulin Pump: An Online Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31057119/),"
Technological developments concerning the treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus have been rapid in the latest years. Insulin infusion systems along with continuous glucose monitoring, as well as long-acting insulin analogues, are part of this progress.
The aim of this study is to present the illness perceptions in type 1 diabetes mellitus, with or without the use of an insulin pump. Sexual life and body image among therapy groups subjected to subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy and multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy were also examined.
A modified version of the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire was used. One hundred and nine adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, (males / females ratio 1:2.3) completed the online survey. Thirty six of them (33%) used CSII therapy and 73 of them (67%) used MDI therapy.
Statistically important differences among the CSII and MDI therapy groups were found in treatment control, illness comprehensibility, representations of control, representation of body image and in the perception of sex life. There was no statistically significant difference among the different types of therapy for participants' negative perception of diabetes.
Negative perceptions of MDI users in treatment control, illness comprehensibility, representations of control, body image and sex life with the insulin pump, differentiate CSII and MDI therapy groups to a significant degree. According to the research, these parameters seem to interfere with accepting CSII therapy for MDI users and discourage them.

Effects of acarbose and siglitine on blood glucose fluctuation and islet β-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30972995/),"
The effects of acarbose and sitagliptin on blood glucose fluctuation and islet β-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) were studied. One hundred and three patients with poorly controlled T2DM with insulin aspart 30 were selected and randomly divided into three groups: group A [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment group], group B (CSII combined with acarbose treatment), group C (CSII combined with sitagliptin treatment). The treatment lasted for two weeks and the clinical indicators in the three groups were measured. The insulin dosage was adjusted according to the blood glucose statuses of the three groups of patients. In the final three days, 72 h of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) were carried out, and the OGTT test was performed again. The results showed that the MODD (absolute means of daily difference), intra-day blood glucose fluctuation indices [(24 h MBG (mean blood glucose), LAGE (largest amplitude of glycemic excursions) and MAGE (average blood glucose fluctuation)] and postprandial blood glucose fluctuation indices [PGS (postprandial glucose spike), △t, PPGE (postprandial glucose excursion) and T (time) total] in group C and group B were significantly lower than those in group A. Compared with group B, the difference in blood glucose fluctuation indices in group C was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The HOMA-islet (homeostasis model assessment of islet) (CP-DM) index and FC-P (Fasting c-peptide) levels in group C and group B were significantly higher than those in group A (P less than 0.01). The HOMA-IR (CP) index of groups B and C was significantly lower than that of group A (P less than 0.01), and there was no statistically significant difference between groups B and C (P less than 0.05). Sitagliptin combined with intensive insulin pump therapy can reduce blood glucose fluctuation throughout the day, reduce insulin dosage, improve islet B cell function and reduce hypoglycemia better than intensive insulin pump therapy alone.

New modes of insulin delivery and new modes of monitoring of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Insulin therapy in type 1 diabetes aims at keeping blood glucose level in a near-normal range. Basal-bolus regimen using multiple daily injections of insulin analogues or, with higher flexibility and precision, an insulin pump fulfils the coverage of basal needs and those related to food intakes. The patch-pumps, discrete and catheter-free, promote the use of continuous insulin delivery. Moving to intra-peritoneal route provides a solution to patients with extreme glucose variability. The combination of continuous glucose monitoring to insulin pumps has opened the way toward glucose-driven insulin therapy, which showed its efficacy in the reduction of hypoglycemia, and more recently on total glucose control through the first hybrid artificial pancreas.

[Hypoglycaemia unawareness in patients with type 1 diabetes].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30786677/),"
Hypoglycaemia unawareness, defined at the onset of neuroglycopenia before the appearance of autonomic warning symptoms, is an serious problem in type 1 diabetes mellitus. It is often caused by recurrent or severe hypoglycaemia, which leads to the failure of the autonomic nervous system (hypoglycaemia-associated autonomic failure - HAAF). The hypoglycaemia awareness can be restored by avoiding episodes of hypoglycaemia. Management of hypoglycaemia unawareness is complex, and can only be achieved by a multifactorial intervention of clinical care and structured patient education. In patients in whom functional intensive insulin therapy with insulin analogue, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using insulin pumps are ineffective in the prevention of hypoglycaemia the implementation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is advisable. CGM systems equipped with low glucose alarms and prediction alarms not only significantly reduce the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, but also significantly reduce the fear of hypoglycaemia and improve the quality of life of patients and their families. The insulin pumps integrated with CGM automatically suspending insulin infusion when glucose is predicted to soon be low (PLGS) should be preferred in patient with hypoglycaemia unawareness. Hypoglycaemia management is complex and should also include structural education. Particular attention should be paid to the management of hypoglycaemia and appropriate use of modern therapy. The hypoglycaemia unawareness is very common among children under the age of 6 years who are unable to observe the early symptoms of hypoglycemia by themselves. This induces a high risk of frequent and severe hypoglycaemia, which can lead to structural changes in the brain, cognitive dysfunctions, poor mental abilities and behavioral disorders later in life.

Insulin Bolus Administration in Insulin Pump Therapy: Effect of Bolus Delivery Speed on Insulin Absorption from Subcutaneous Tissue.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30620643/),"
This study assessed subcutaneous absorption kinetics of rapid-acting insulin administered as a bolus using bolus delivery speeds commonly employed in commercially available insulin pumps (i.e., 2 and 40 s for delivering 1 insulin unit).
Twenty C-peptide-negative type 1 diabetic subjects were studied on two occasions, separated by at least 7 days, using the euglycemic clamp procedure. After an overnight fast, subjects were given, in random order, a subcutaneous insulin bolus (15 U of insulin lispro, Eli Lilly) either for 30 s using an Animas IR2020 pump (fast bolus delivery) or for 10 min using a Medtronic Minimed Paradigm 512 pump (slow bolus delivery).
Fast bolus delivery resulted in an earlier onset of insulin action as compared with slow bolus delivery (21.0 ± 2.5 vs. 34.3 ± 2.7 min; P < 0.002). Furthermore, time to reach maximum insulin effect was found to be 27 min earlier with fast bolus delivery as compared with slow bolus delivery (98 ± 11 vs. 125 ± 16 min; P < 0.005). In addition, the area under the plasma insulin curve from 0 to 60 min for fast bolus delivery was greater than the one for slow bolus delivery (10,307 ± 1291 vs. 8192 ± 865 min·pmol/L; P = 0.027).
Results suggest that insulin bolus delivery with fast delivery speed may result in more rapid insulin absorption and, thus, may provide a better control of meal-related glucose excursions than that obtained with bolus delivery using slow delivery speeds. Our findings may have important implications for the future design of the bolus delivery unit of insulin pumps.

Cost-effectiveness of Initiating an Insulin Pump in T1D Adults Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring Compared with Multiple Daily Insulin Injections: The DIAMOND Randomized Trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30403576/),"
The economic impact of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and insulin pumps (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) in type 1 diabetes (T1D) have been evaluated separately. However, the cost-effectiveness of adding CSII to existing CGM users has not yet been assessed.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the societal cost-effectiveness of CSII versus continuing multiple daily injections (MDI) in adults with T1D already using CGM.
In the second phase of the DIAMOND trial, 75 adults using CGM were randomized to either CGM+CSII or CGM+MDI (control) and surveyed at baseline and 28 weeks. We performed within-trial and lifetime cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) via a modified Sheffield T1D model.
Within the trial, the CGM+CSII group had a significant reduction in quality of life from baseline (-0.02 Â± 0.05 difference in difference [DiD]) compared with controls. Total per-person 28-week costs were $8,272 (CGM+CSII) versus $5,623 (CGM+MDI); the difference in costs was primarily attributable to pump use ($2,644). Pump users reduced insulin intake (-12.8 units DiD) but increased the use of daily number of test strips (+1.2 DiD). Pump users also increased time with glucose in range of 70 to 180 mg/dL but had a higher HbA1c (+0.13 DiD) and more nonsevere hypoglycemic events. In the lifetime CEA, CGM+CSII would increase total costs by $112,045 DiD, decrease QALYs by 0.71, and decrease life expectancy by 0.48 years.
Based on this single trial, initiating an insulin pump in adults with T1D already using CGM was associated with higher costs and reduced quality of life. Additional evidence regarding the clinical effects of adopting combinations of new technologies from trials and real-world populations is needed to confirm these findings.

Type 1 Diabetes: Management Strategies.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30215903/),"
There is considerable benefit of tight glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Tight blood glucose control dramatically decreases the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications. Although glycemic goals should be individualized, most nonpregnant adults should strive for an A1C level less than 7%. Greater frequency of glucose monitoring and continuous glucose monitoring are both associated with lower A1C levels. The choice to monitor glucose levels via multiple daily capillary blood samples or continuous glucose monitoring is based on cost and patient preference. Intensive insulin treatment is recommended with a combination of multiple mealtime bolus and basal injections or with continuous insulin infusion through an insulin pump. The option to administer insulin with multiple daily injections vs. a pump should be individualized. Adjunctive medical therapy is under investigation but is not currently recommended. All patients with type 1 diabetes should participate in diabetes self-management education and develop individualized premeal insulin bolus plans under the guidance of a dietitian, if possible. Blood pressure and lipid control are important to prevent cardiovascular disease events. Patients with type 1 diabetes should have sick-day plans and be able to identify warning signs of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Advances in diabetes care, including the bionic pancreas and the closed-loop system of glucose monitoring with an automated insulin pump, may have a significant effect on type 1 diabetes care in the years ahead.

Objectively Measured Adherence in Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes on Multiple Daily Injections and Insulin Pump Therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30184209/),"
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) poses unique challenges to adherence-related behavior because of complex treatment regimens that vary by use of specific technologies. This study used objective data to determine (1) prevalence rates of adherence behaviors in adolescents with T1D, and (2) relationships between adherence and glycemic control.
Data were downloaded for the past 30 consecutive days from glucose meters and multiple insulin pump models for 80 youth (11-17 years old; n = 40 on multiple daily injections (MDIs) and n = 40 on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]). Frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG; MDI and CSII users); carbohydrate entry (CSII users); daily insulin bolus delivery (CSII users); episodes of high, very high, and dangerously high hyperglycemia; and correction bolusing for hyperglycemia (CSII users) were calculated.
Participants completed SMBG ≥4 times/day on 46.13% of days (MDI users), 48.74% of days (CSII users nonmanual entries only), and 59.07% of days (CSII users; manual plus nonmanual entries). CSII users entered carbohydrates ≥3 times/day on 61.47% of days and bloused insulin ≥3 times/ day on 87.34% of days. Hyperglycemic readings were followed by a correction bolus in <70% of cases. Greater SMBG, carbohydrate entry, bolus insulin delivery, and correction bolusing for high and very high hyperglycemia predicted lower glycated hemoglobin (sample M = 8.74%, SD = 1.75%).
Objective data from diabetes technology are helpful to differentiate adherence to specific domains of treatment but are complex in nature. Findings support a need for further research to elucidate predictive factors of suboptimal adherence in adolescents with T1D.

Improving the Insulin Pump Initiation Process for Pediatric Patients with Type 1 Diabetes through Application of Lean Quality Improvement Methods.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30005730/),"
Our pediatric diabetes center initiated insulin pump therapy for more than 250 patients with type 1 diabetes in 2014, but onboarding was inefficient.
To decrease time from the decision to initiate pump therapy to the ambulatory encounter after pump start (lead time) for new pump users from 132.5 days to less than 110 days within 5 months.
Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control method. We identified key problems: Long wait for training classes, unclear metrics, complicated scheduling, and nonstandardized processes. We then implemented 17 changes, including shortened classes, increased class offerings and space, clarified metrics, built a reporting dashboard, designated and cross-trained staff, created appeals letter templates, and educated clinicians. At project conclusion, we established a reaction plan if the processes were not performing as designed.
Outcomes of pump orders placed before and after improvements were implemented.
During this project, 229 patients initiated the pump start process. Median lead time decreased from 132.5 to 98.5 days (p = 0.007). Patients with lead time under 110 days increased from 37% to 60% (p = 0.001). There were 31 pump nonstarters, with no significant association between group and whether the patient was a starter or nonstarter (p = 0.58). Nonstarters had a longer diabetes duration (median = 3.43 vs 2.05 years, p = 0.001).
Project goals were met. A high proportion of patients not starting pump therapy was discovered, but this was not affected by the project. We implemented further changes and a process-monitoring system.

Avoiding hypoglycemia: the use of insulin pump combined with continuous glucose monitor in type 1 diabetes crossing a Rocky Gorge.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29939323/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) have been proven very effective in diabetes management.
This study evaluated the usefulness of these devices during prolonged, intense physical activity in an uncontrolled natural environment away from the clinical research center.
Non-randomized, prospective and observational study.
During the summer, 38 participants with type 1 diabetes crossed the Samaria gorge, the second largest gorge in Europe (17 km). Twenty subjects on CSII combined with real-time CGMS and 18 on multiple daily injections (MDI) combined with professional (retrospective) CGMS participated in the program. All participants were unsupervised during the event.
All 38 participants managed to reach the destination point safely. There were no episodes of severe hypoglycemia. The duration of the exercise (mean ±SD) was 6.4 ± 1.3 h. The CSII group exhibited significantly lower hypoglycemic episodes during exercise (0.1 ± 0.3 vs. 0.4 ± 0.6; P = 0.047) as well as lower AUC below 70 mg/dl compared with the MDI, during the 24 h (0.61 ± 0.78 vs. 1.84 ± 1.55; P = 0.007). Individuals on CSII were significantly less likely to develop a hypoglycemic episode during exercise (P = 0.038). Exercise induced nocturnal hypoglycemia was not prevented effectively in neither group.
CSII combined with CGMS is effective in controlling blood glucose levels in type 1 diabetics who perform prolonged strenuous exercise. The use of insulin pump technology in regions with hot Mediterranean climates is safe and can provide protection against exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Development of precise instructions for T1DM who occasionally get involved in exercise activities, requires further studies.

"IMPROVED HBA1C, TOTAL DAILY INSULIN DOSE, AND TREATMENT SATISFACTION WITH INSULIN PUMP THERAPY COMPARED TO MULTIPLE DAILY INSULIN INJECTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES IRRESPECTIVE OF BASELINE C-PEPTIDE LEVELS.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29847166/),"
Fasting C-peptide levels are used to differentiate type 1 from type 2 diabetes (T2D), thereby determining eligibility for coverage of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for patients with T2D.
A total of 168 patients (74 female/94 male, aged 55.5 ± 9.7 years) were randomized to CSII, and 163 patients (77 female/86 male, aged 56.4 ± 9.5 years) were randomized to multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin and grouped by baseline C-peptide level: group A (≤183 pmol/L [≤0.55 ng/mL]); group B (>183 pmol/L [>0.55 ng/mL]). At 6 months, the MDI group crossed over to CSII. Within- and between-group comparisons were recorded at 6 and 12 months in the entire group and separately for those patients aged ≥65 years.
CSII reduced hemoglobin A1c (A1c) equally in groups A ( P = .0006, P = .0022) and B ( P<.0001, P<.0001) at 6 and 12 months, respectively. There was an increase in weight in group A versus group B at 6 months but not 12 months ( P<.03). CSII therapy reduced total daily dose (TDD) of insulin and improved treatment satisfaction similarly in groups A and B. The results for patients aged ≥65 years displayed a similar trend as the entire group.
A1c, TDD of insulin, and treatment satisfaction improved for T2D patients using CSII versus MDI therapy, irrespective of baseline C-peptide level. A subgroup of patients aged ≥65 years displayed a similar trend. These results support abandoning C-peptide as a criterion for reimbursing CSII therapy in patients with diabetes.

WHICH FACTORS MAY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS USING THE MEDTRONIC VEO CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION PUMP?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29745917/),"
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) is considered an effective therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM). Literature offers limited information regarding the quality of life (QoL) in patients using CSII. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of diabetes related factors on the QoL of patients with T1DM on CSII treatment, in a Greek urban population. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 80 patients with T1DM using CSII. [(Mean±SD) age: 35.9±11.4 years, duration of diabetes: 24.2±10.3 years, BMI: 24.6±3.5kg/m2, duration of Insulin pump use: 7.1±3.9 years, HbA1c: 7.7±1.1%, gender: 37 males-43 females)]. QoL was assessed using the patient self-administered EuroQol EQ 5D validated in Greek. Correlation and regression analyses were performed to examine the relationship between EQ index - EQ VAS scores and diabetes related factors. Hypoglycemia Awareness was measured using Clarke and Gold Score questionnaires, Hypoglycemic Episodes were expressed as number of episodes per week and the Fear of Hypoglycemia was measured using the worry subscale of the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS-W). Results were as follows: Gold score: 2.8±1.5, Clarke score: 2.8±2.1, Hypoglycemia Fear Score: 20.6±11.2, Number of hypoglycemic Episodes per week: 4.3±2.9, VAS score: 68.7±18.1, EQ index: 0.79±0.24. In univariate analyses QoL was negatively correlated with Hypoglycemic episodes, HbA1c, Hypoglycemia Fear Score and Hypoglycemia Awareness status. After regression analysis, only HbA1c and the number of hypoglycemic episodes per week remained independently related to QoL scores. Prevention of hypoglycemia and glycemic control should be emphasized in order to improve QoL in patients with T1DM with CSII.

No title,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29553668/),"
Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become one of the most common public health problems
world-wide. According to the 2014 Norwegian Public Health report, diabetes affects an
estimated 4.3% of the Norwegian population. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder resulting
from a defect in insulin production, secretion, action, or all. Type 1 and 2 are the two
main types, with the prevalence of type 2 accounting for the majority (>85%) of
diabetes. This assessment will focus on FreeStyle Libre, flash glucose monitor for insulin
treated individuals with type 1 and 2 diabetes (“Type 1 and 2 DM”). To achieve proper quality of life and reduce long-term problems, people are increasingly
encouraged to take an active role in the management of their condition. Adequate treatment
management, aimed at tight control of blood glucose, reduces the risk of the long-term
complications of diabetes such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, coronary heart
disease, ischaemic stroke and peripheral vascular disease. “Management” of the disease
should be understood as a package including testing of blood glucose, taking insulin
(i.e., multiple daily insulin injections, using an insulin pump), using
anti-hyperglycemic drugs, or adopting lifestyle interventions such as diet and physical
activity. In recent years, and available in Europe since 2014, the FreeStyle Libre System -- a
“wireless” method using a sensor for monitoring interstitial fluid glucose -- was
introduced to help individuals with type 1 and 2 DM achieve better glucose control. The
system, unlike others, does not require finger prick calibration, since that functionality
is embedded into the core technology. Also, unlike other systems, the individual has to
take active action to get access to the real time glucose value, by leading the receiver
over the sensor. Similarly to other continuous glucose monitoring options, it relies on
the individual to take action on the information retrieved.
Our goal was to assess the clinical effectiveness, cost effectiveness and safety of
FreeStyle Libre for individuals with type 1 and 2 DM.
We conducted a systematic review according to standard methods to summarise the evidence.
The study populations were insulin treated individuals with Type 1 or 2 DM, the
intervention was FreeStyle Libre, and the outcomes were HbA1c, hypo and hyperglycaemia,
quality of life, patient satisfaction, pain, and adverse events. We searched databases, trial registries, health technology assessment agencies websites
and grey literature from inception to January 2017 with no language restrictions. Two
reviewers independently screened the titles and abstracts of all records identified by
searches, discussed any discrepancies and solved them by consensus. We obtained full text
copies of all studies deemed potentially relevant and the same two reviewers independently
assessed these for inclusion; solving any disagreements by consensus. One reviewer
extracted data relating to study details, participants, intervention, and comparator,
using a piloted, standard data extraction form. A second reviewer checked data extraction
and any disagreements we resolved by consensus. The assessment of the methodological
quality of each included study was based on the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.
Quality assessment of evidence was carried out independently by two reviewers. We solved
any disagreements by consensus. Meta-analysis was considered a suitable analysis for the
data identified, despite heterogeneity. For some outcomes we employed a narrative
synthesis.
We assessed the cost-effectiveness estimates provided by the submitter of FreeStyle Libre
compared to self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) for individuals with type 1 and 2 DM. The
submitter used a commercially available cost-effectiveness model, IMS CORE diabetes model
(IMS CDM) for this assessment. The model is internet based, with a Markov application, for
individuals >18 years. The interactive simulation predicts the long-term health
outcomes and costs associated with the management of type 1 and 2 DM. The model consist of
17 sub-models designed to simulate diabetes related complications, nonspecific mortality,
and costs over time. As the model simulates individual patients over time, it updates risk
factors and complications to account for disease progression. However, this model received
from the submitter, lacks transparency, and made it difficult to gain a firm understanding
of the factors that determine how patients progress through the model, assumptions and
parameters effect outcomes and to assess the validity of the model. Because the Norwegian
Institute of Public Health did not have complete access to the model, it was not possible
to perform a full assessment of the model or to modify underlying assumptions and
parameters in order to independently assess the impact on reported results. Furthermore,
the documentation package did not include any sensitivity analysis, which is essential for
considering the validity and robustness of results from economic evaluations.
We included two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in the review. These studies compared
FreeStyle Libre to SMBG. Also, we found several publications investigating the accuracy of
the device, however, the study designs of these studies (single arm) did not meet the
inclusion criteria of this evaluation and, although we compiled them for information, they
were excluded from the synthesis. The information derived from these single arm studies
are potentially important to validate the sensitivity and specificity estimates of
FreeStyle Libre. In addition, we found other European assessments conducted in the past 6
to 8 months. The included RCTs reported data on middle aged adults from European countries
with type 1 and 2 DM at 6 months post intervention. We rated the studies’ risk of bias as
unclear to high risk. Main findings from these trials are that FreeStyle Libre may slightly improve treatment
satisfaction, time spent with glucose in range 3.9 to 10 mmol/L, number of nocturnal
events with glucose levels <3.1 mmol/L within 7h, and time spent with glucose levels
>13.0 mmol/L in comparison to SMBG. FreeStyle Libre lead to little or no difference in
quality of life and HbA1c level in comparison to SMBG. The evidence is uncertain about
whether FreeStyle Libre leads to an improvement in time and events with glucose
<3.9mmol/L within 24 h, time with glucose <3.1 mmol/L at night within 7 hours, and
time with glucose >10 mmol/L. The submitted economic model runs a 40-year time horizon. The submitter's basecase
suggested that the technology is dominant for individuals with type 1 DM,
i.e. that FreeStyle Libre is a cheaper and more effective technology.
According to submitter's base case, individuals with type 2 DM the incremental
cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated to be NOK 235,673 per QALY (whole study
population) and NOK 243,434 per QALY (under 65 years). As the model received by the
submitter was neither sufficiently transparent nor sufficiently flexible to allow changes,
we have not been able to produce alternative incremental cost-effectiveness ratios
(ICERs). From a healthcare perspective, the submitter has calculated a budget impact for
type 1 DM to have a total added cost the fifth year after adoption of the technology.
Further, the submitter calculated a budget impact for type 1 and 2 DM that lead to a cost
saving on the fifth year after adoption of the techonology. The submitter did not
calculate a budget impact for type 2 DM only. We estimated that, from a healthcare perspective, the annual costs five years after
introduction would be NOK 186 million added cost and NOK 91.7 million saved cost for type
1 and 2 DM alone, respectively, and NOK 94 million added cost for type 1 and 2 DM
combined.
Overall, the evidence for the intervention of interest was limited but suggests that
FreeStyle Libre increases treatment satisfaction, reduces some hypo- and hyperglycaemic
measures (increases time with glucose in range 3.9 to 10 mmol/L, reduces time and number
of events with glucose <3.9 in 24 hours, number of glucose <3.1 night events and
time with glucose >13 mmol/L) and has similar serious adverse events than SMBG, without
differences in other outcomes including HbA1c and quality of life. The quality of the included studies was generally low and there were only two small
studies including middle aged adults. Several inconsistencies lead us to question the result of the submitted health economic
report. Specifically, the submitted model included several input data that did not match
the input data described in the submitted documentation package, and nor did it match the
input data found in other literature. The most challenging issue is that the model is not sufficiently transparent or flexible,
since we did not have access to the complete model. Therefore, we were not able to assess
how the possible adjustments would affect the results provided by the submitters.
Independent research for FreeStyle Libre will be important. Diabetes affects the life of children, adolescents and their caregivers in many
ways, as well as pregnant women. Independent research including these groups is
warranted. The clinical effectiveness of FreeStyle Libre needs to be investigated in different
conditions, for example, among individuals with poor self-monitoring adherence,
newly diagnosed, impaired awareness of hypoglycaemia, and in addition to training
and education components. FreeStyle Libre compared to other continuous monitoring systems is warranted. Pain is a major determinant of diabetes treatment adherence, especially for
children, and it should be included as an individual outcome in future trials. Future trials should include longer term follow up and quality of life outcome
assessments at various points to inform improved clinical and cost effectiveness
modelling.

MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES DURING AIR TRAVEL: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW OF CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEIR SUPPORTING EVIDENCE.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29466062/),"
Individuals with diabetes are increasingly seeking pretravel advice, but updated professional recommendations remain scant. We performed a systematic review on diabetes management during air travel to summarize current recommendations, assess supporting evidence, and identify areas of future research.
A systematic review of the English literature on diabetes management during air travel was undertaken utilizing PubMed and MEDLINE. Publications regarding general travel advice; adjustment of insulin and noninsulin therapies; and the use of insulin pumps, glucometers and subcutaneous glucose sensors at altitude were included. Gathered information was used to create an updated summary of glucose-lowering medication adjustment during air travel.
Sixty-one publications were identified, most providing expert opinion and few offering primary data (47 expert opinion, 2 observational studies, 2 case reports, 10 device studies). General travel advice was uniform, with increasing attention to preflight security. Indications for oral antihyperglycemic therapy adjustments varied. There were few recommendations on contemporary agents and on nonhypoglycemic adverse events. There was little consensus on insulin adjustment protocols, many antedating current insulin formulations. Most publications advocated adjusting insulin pump time settings after arrival; however, there was disagreement on timing and rate adjustments. Glucometers and subcutaneous glucose sensors were reported to be less accurate at altitude, but not to an extent that would preclude their clinical use.
Recommendations for diabetes management during air travel vary significantly and are mostly based on expert opinion. Data from systematic investigation on glucose-lowering medication adjustment protocols may support the development of a future consensus statement.

Impact of Insulin Delivery Method on Hypoglycemia Incidence in Pediatric Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29416197/),"
Insulin therapy of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is highly demanding due to their dynamic growth, development and different daily life activities.
To determine the optimal insulin delivery method for the prevention of hypoglycemia recorded by continuous monitoring of glucose in patients with insulin pump and PEN.
The study included patients up to 18 years of age with diagnosed T1DM and treated with insulin pump and by insulin therapy with PEN at the Pediatric Clinic of the Clinical Center in Sarajevo. The study involved 149 patients, and lasted for 3 years. Patients were divided into two groups: group of patients on insulin pump therapy and group on insulin PEN.
There were 73 patients (49.6%) on insulin pump therapy and 79 patients (52.4%) on the insulin PEN therapy. There was no significant difference in the age between genders nor groups with different insulin application methods. There were no significant differences in the number of anamnestic hypoglycemia in patients with a different mode of insulin application (83.56% vs. 81.58%, p=0.114, F=2.533 < Fk=3.919). The number of hypoglycemia episodes in history is higher with the PEN therapy than in the insulin pump group.
The number of anamnesis hypoglycemia as well as hypoglycemia from CGM records did not differ significantly in patients with IP and PEN therapy. The CGM record was significantly more valuable in the presentation of hypoglycemia compared to the history of hypoglycemia in all patients studied. Continuous monitoring of glycemia due to the ability to show glycemia variability and unrecognized hypoglycemia as well as predictive options for long-term metabolic control should be performed for all T1DM patients at least once a year.

Pump Users Clamor for Faster Insulin: Is Fast-Acting Insulin Aspart Ready for Them?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29291651/),"
Recently approved in Europe, Canada, and the United States, fast-acting insulin aspart (FIASPÂ®) is a new rapid acting insulin. Approved for subcutaneous or IV injection use, there is little data available regarding the clinical utility of FIASP in insulin pumps. The article by Zijlstra and colleagues in this issue begins to close this gap by testing pump compatibility of FIASP in the clinic. Reporting on a small (37 subjects) and short (6 weeks) study looking at aspects of infusion set propensity for clogging and malfunction, no cases of infusion set plugging in either FIASP (25 subjects) or insulin aspart (12 subjects) were seen. Unexplained hyperglycemia and premature infusion set changes were more common with FIASP than with insulin aspart. This study demonstrated sufficient safety and efficacy of FIASP in the pump setting to pave the way for longer, larger and more definitive clinical trials.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an acquired autoimmune disease, caused by antibodies against platelet glycoproteins, which provoke platelet destruction and inhibit platelet production in bone marrow. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is an acquired autoimmune disease in witch beta cells are destroyed by autoantibodies. Patient with T1DM since the age of 6, was treated by intensive functional insulin therapy by insulin pump. At the age of 14,5 he was also diagnosed with ITP. Due to the short effect of immunoglobulin therapy, glucocorticoids were introduced. After 3 months of glucocorticotherapy the platelet count was 46 G/l. Patient developed various adverse effects of glucocorticoids, among others stretch marks covering all surface of his abdomen, buttocks, arms and thighs and raise in the daily requirement of insulin by 200%. Adverse effects of glucocorticotherapy made impossible the therapy by insulin pump and imposed urgent revision of the ITP therapy. Side effects of the glucocorticotherapy can make impossible the treatment by insulin pump of T1DM in children.

"Association of Insulin Pump Therapy vs Insulin Injection Therapy With Severe Hypoglycemia, Ketoacidosis, and Glycemic Control Among Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29049584/),"
Insulin pump therapy may improve metabolic control in young patients with type 1 diabetes, but the association with short-term diabetes complications is unclear.
To determine whether rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis are lower with insulin pump therapy compared with insulin injection therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes.
Population-based cohort study conducted between January 2011 and December 2015 in 446 diabetes centers participating in the Diabetes Prospective Follow-up Initiative in Germany, Austria, and Luxembourg. Patients with type 1 diabetes younger than 20 years and diabetes duration of more than 1 year were identified. Propensity score matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses with age, sex, diabetes duration, migration background (defined as place of birth outside of Germany or Austria), body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin as covariates were used to account for relevant confounders.
Type 1 diabetes treated with insulin pump therapy or with multiple (≥4) daily insulin injections.
Primary outcomes were rates of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis during the most recent treatment year. Secondary outcomes included glycated hemoglobin levels, insulin dose, and body mass index.
Of 30 579 patients (mean age, 14.1 years [SD, 4.0]; 53% male), 14 119 used pump therapy (median duration, 3.7 years) and 16 460 used insulin injections (median duration, 3.6 years). Patients using pump therapy (n = 9814) were matched with 9814 patients using injection therapy. Pump therapy, compared with injection therapy, was associated with lower rates of severe hypoglycemia (9.55 vs 13.97 per 100 patient-years; difference, -4.42 [95% CI, -6.15 to -2.69]; P < .001) and diabetic ketoacidosis (3.64 vs 4.26 per 100 patient-years; difference, -0.63 [95% CI, -1.24 to -0.02]; P = .04). Glycated hemoglobin levels were lower with pump therapy than with injection therapy (8.04% vs 8.22%; difference, -0.18 [95% CI, -0.22 to -0.13], P < .001). Total daily insulin doses were lower for pump therapy compared with injection therapy (0.84 U/kg vs 0.98 U/kg; difference, -0.14 [-0.15 to -0.13], P < .001). There was no significant difference in body mass index between both treatment regimens. Similar results were obtained after propensity score inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses in the entire cohort.
Among young patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin pump therapy, compared with insulin injection therapy, was associated with lower risks of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis and with better glycemic control during the most recent year of therapy. These findings provide evidence for improved clinical outcomes associated with insulin pump therapy compared with injection therapy in children, adolescents, and young adults with type 1 diabetes.

Increased arterial stiffness in childhood onset diabetes: a cardiovascular magnetic resonance study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28950341/),"
Arterial stiffness is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events. We aimed to assess the impact of type 1 diabetes (T1D) on arterial stiffness and cardiac function in young adults.
Aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), distensibility, left ventricular (LV) function and LV mass were measured by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) in 47 T1D patients and 33 healthy controls. All were participants in the Atherosclerosis and Childhood Diabetes study, with baseline values registered 5 years previously. The patients had a mean age of 20.8 years and a median duration of diabetes of 10.0 years. PWV was significantly higher in the diabetes group compared with controls, mean 4.10 (SD = 4.58) vs. 3.90 (SD = 4.04) m/s, P = 0.045. In the diabetes group, insulin pump users at baseline had lower PWV than multiple injection users, mean 3.94 (SD = 0.38) vs. 4.23 (SD = 0.48) m/s, P = 0.028. Also in the diabetes group, multiple regression analysis identified C-reactive protein (CRP), female gender and insulin pump use as independent baseline risk factors for PWV 5 years later. There was no difference in cardiac function or LV mass between the diabetes and control groups.
In this prospective study, we found increased PWV assessed by CMR in young adults with T1D compared with controls. Also, CRP, female gender and insulin pump use emerged as independent baseline risk factors for PWV 5 years later.

[From insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring to the artificial pancreas].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28898340/),"
Technology for diabetes care has undergone major development during recent decades. These technological advances include continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), also known as insulin pumps, and real-time continuous glucose monitoring system (RT-CGMS). The integration of CSII and RT-CGMS into a single device has led to sensor-augmented pump therapy and more recently, a technology that has automated delivery of basal insulin therapy, known as hybrid system. These new technologies have led to benefits in attaining better metabolic control and decreasing the incidence of severe hypoglycemia, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes. This review describes the types of technologies currently available or under investigation for these purposes, their benefits and disadvantages, recommendations and the appropriate patient selection for their use. The clinical use of the hybrid system and artificial pancreas seem to be possible in the near future.

[Insulin pump in type 2 diabetes: B-cell focused treatment].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28840741/),"
Type 2 diabetes is a disorder characterized by insulin resistance and progressive deterioration of B-cell insulin secretion. B-cell protective strategies for lowering glucolipotoxicity by rapid achievement of normoglycemia using exogenous insulin improve their function and prolong diabetes remission. Insulin pump is an effective treatment method in newly diagnosed diabetes, where even short-term pump therapy is B-cell protective. Combination therapy with insulin pump and antidiabetics targeting the incretin system acts in synergy to protect the B-cell. While the positive effect of insulin pump is apparent even a year after stopping the therapy, the effect of incretins lasts only while on the medication. Short-term insulin treatment, especially delivered by insulin pump, is an effective method of B-cell protection in recent type 2 diabetes.Key words: B-cell function - diabetes mellitus - insulin pump - insulin resistance - type 2 diabetes.

Examination of Psychosocial and Physiological Risk for Bulimic Symptoms in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes Transitioning to an Insulin Pump: A Pilot Study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28535306/),"
This study tested hypotheses drawn from a risk model positing that psychosocial risk plus disease-related and treatment factors contribute to bulimic symptoms in youth with type 1 diabetes (T1D) transitioning to an insulin pump. The goal of this study was to examine whether disease-related factors, particularly disease- and treatment-based disruption in hunger and satiety, contribute to report of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D after accounting for psychosocial risk factors.
43 youth (ages 10-17, 54% female) with established T1D were recruited before transition from multiple daily injections to insulin-pump therapy from three tertiary pediatric diabetes centers. Participants completed measures of bulimic symptoms, depressive symptoms dietary restraint, and the Diabetes Treatment and Satiety Scale, a diabetes-specific questionnaire assessing hunger and satiety cues and eating behavior in response to blood glucose levels and treatment.
Hierarchical multiple regression was used to assess contributions of psychosocial and disease-based risk to report of bulimic symptoms. After assessing the contributions of body mass index, body image dissatisfaction, and dietary restraint, a significant 2-way interaction emerged between depression and diabetes-related uncontrollable hunger related to bulimic symptoms (β = 1.82, p < .01).
In addition to psychosocial risk, disease- and treatment-based hunger and satiety dysregulation appear to be important factors contributing to report of bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D. These preliminary findings have significant treatment implications for bulimic symptoms in youth with T1D.

"A cluster randomised trial, cost-effectiveness analysis and psychosocial evaluation of insulin pump therapy compared with multiple injections during flexible intensive insulin therapy for type 1 diabetes: the REPOSE Trial.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28440211/),"
Insulin is generally administered to people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) using multiple daily injections (MDIs), but can also be delivered using infusion pumps. In the UK, pumps are recommended for patients with the greatest need and adult use is less than in comparable countries. Previous trials have been small, of short duration and have failed to control for training in insulin adjustment.
To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of pump therapy compared with MDI for adults with T1DM, with both groups receiving equivalent structured training in flexible insulin therapy.
Pragmatic, multicentre, open-label, parallel-group cluster randomised controlled trial, including economic and psychosocial evaluations. After participants were assigned a group training course, courses were randomly allocated in pairs to either pump or MDI.
Eight secondary care diabetes centres in the UK.
Adults with T1DM for > 12 months, willing to undertake intensive insulin therapy, with no preference for pump or MDI, or a clinical indication for pumps.
Pump or MDI structured training in flexible insulin therapy, followed up for 2 years. MDI participants used insulin analogues. Pump participants used a Medtronic Paradigm® VeoTM (Medtronic, Watford, UK) with insulin aspart (NovoRapid, Novo Nordisk, Gatwick, UK).
Primary outcome - change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) at 2 years in participants whose baseline HbA1c was ≥ 7.5% (58 mmol/mol). Key secondary outcome - proportion of participants with HbA1c ≤ 7.5% at 2 years. Other outcomes at 6, 12 and 24 months - moderate and severe hypoglycaemia; insulin dose; body weight; proteinuria; diabetic ketoacidosis; quality of life (QoL); fear of hypoglycaemia; treatment satisfaction; emotional well-being; qualitative interviews with participants and staff (2 weeks), and participants (6 months); and ICERs in trial and modelled estimates of cost-effectiveness.
We randomised 46 courses comprising 317 participants: 267 attended a Dose Adjustment For Normal Eating course (132 pump; 135 MDI); 260 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, of which 235 (119 pump; 116 MDI) had baseline HbA1c of ≥ 7.5%. HbA1c and severe hypoglycaemia improved in both groups. The drop in HbA1c% at 2 years was 0.85 on pump and 0.42 on MDI. The mean difference (MD) in HbA1c change at 2 years, at which the baseline HbA1c was ≥ 7.5%, was -0.24% [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.53% to 0.05%] in favour of the pump (p = 0.098). The per-protocol analysis showed a MD in change of -0.36% (95% CI -0.64% to -0.07%) favouring pumps (p = 0.015). Pumps were not cost-effective in the base case and all of the sensitivity analyses. The pump group had greater improvement in diabetes-specific QoL diet restrictions, daily hassle plus treatment satisfaction, statistically significant at 12 and 24 months and supported by qualitative interviews.
Blinding of pump therapy was not possible, although an objective primary outcome was used.
Adding pump therapy to structured training in flexible insulin therapy did not significantly enhance glycaemic control or psychosocial outcomes in adults with T1DM.
To understand why few patients achieve a HbA1c of < 7.5%, particularly as glycaemic control is worse in the UK than in other European countries.

Pediatric Insulin Pump Therapy: Reflecting on the First 10 Years of a Universal Funding Program in Ontario.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28130944/),"
We evaluated the universal funding program for pediatric insulin pumps in Ontario by examining the dynamics underlying patterns of pump use and adverse events using population-based health administrative data available at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), supplemented by other data. We found that (1) pump use has increased steadily since 2006 with variation across centres and disparity in use by socioeconomic status; (2) pump discontinuation is uncommon; (3) physicians value pump therapy in numerous ways that provide important insights into patterns of uptake; and (4) the safety profile of pump therapy is, in general, very good; however, individuals of lower socioeconomic status are at an increased risk of acute diabetes complications, most frequently diabetic ketoacidosis. This comprehensive mixed-methods evaluation reveals the need to understand and intervene to reduce social disparities in the use and adverse outcomes of technologies used for diabetes management.

Reexamining the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey for Parents of Young Children in a Sample of Children Using Insulin Pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28118046/),"
We update the psychometric properties of the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey-Parents of Young Children (HFS-PYC), a 26-item measure of parents' hypoglycemia fear for young children using an insulin pump.
We combined three similar datasets for the analyses. The data analyzed included parents' responses to the HFS-PYC and a demographic form. For a subset of children (n = 91), we also analyzed self-monitoring of blood glucose data. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the measure's original factor structure. Additional analyses examined reliability and validity of a revised HFS-PYC for parents of young children using pumps.
We analyzed data from 116 parents (93% mothers). Mean child age and HbA1c were 5.2 ± 1.3 years and 8.2% ± 1.1%, respectively. CFA identified a 22-item two-factor solution (χ2 (208, n = 116) = 368.688, P < 0.001, root mean square error of approximation = 0.08, comparative fit index = 0.94, and Tucker-Lewis index = 0.93) with factors corresponding to the original subscales: worry and behavior. The revised subscales demonstrated at least adequate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha >0.65). Correlations revealed significant negative associations between current HFS-PYC worry scores and children's mean daily blood glucose and percent of very high glucose levels per day, suggesting less fear among parents of young children with elevated glycemic levels. In addition, there was a positive association with the percent of glucose levels in target, suggesting greater hypoglycemia fear among parents of children who have better control.
Results provide preliminary evidence for the reliability and validity of a reduced 22-item HFS-PYC for parents of children using insulin pumps.

Kurnaz E, Aycan Z, Yıldırım N, Çetinkaya S. Conventional insulin pump therapy in two neonatal diabetes patients harboring the homozygous PTF1A enhancer mutation: Need for a novel approach for the management of neonatal diabetes. Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 458-462. The enhancer of PTF1A mutation causes developmental defects of the pancreas. This condition can result in insulin-requiring diabetes and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. We report two patients with diabetes mellitus harboring the homozygous PTF1A enhancer mutation. The patients had hyperglycemia in the first month of life and were started with subcutaneous insulin injections with NPH insulin. When blood glucose (BG) exceeded 250 mg/dl, a conservative dose of rapid-acting insulin was administered to restore BG to the target range. In cases with documented poor control (persistent hypoglycemia and rebound hyperglycemia), it was decided that the baby would benefit from a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump. But our experience shows that wide fluctuations in BG concentrations despite the strict follow-up was probably due to the absence of circulating glucagon. Further treatment options would overcome this problem, especially for children with pancreas agenesis. We could say theoretically that using diluted insulin, a sensor-augmented insulin pump system and single-hormone (insulin alone) and dual-hormone (insulin and glucagon) artificial pancreas systems may mitigate the severity of hypogylcemia.

Spontaneous and transient predinner hyperglycemia in some patients with diabetes: Dusk phenomenon.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27893687/),"
Blood glucose fluctuations have higher risk than absolute blood glucose level in diabetic chronic complications. At present, ""dawn phenomenon"" is well known by clinicians, but ""dusk phenomenon"" has not been recognized. This study explored the objective existence of ""dusk phenomenon"" (spontaneous and transient predinner hyperglycemia) and its clinical significance.The data of 54 patients with diabetes, who received routine insulin pump therapy between December 2010 and October 2012 in our hospital, were retrospectively analyzed. These patients included 4 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) (T1DM) and 50 patients with type 2 DM (T2DM). According to the difference between predinner and postlunch blood glucose levels, the 50 patients with T2DM were divided into dusk phenomenon group (4 patients, all the differences ≥0 mmol/L during insulin pump therapy), nondusk phenomenon group (12 patients, all the differences <0 mmol/L during insulin pump therapy), and suspicious group (34 patients, the differences were uncertain during insulin pump therapy). In the 4 patients with T1DM of this study, the differences all were more than 0 mmol/L during insulin pump therapy. The changes in blood glucose levels were observed, and the correlations of blood glucose level with other factors were analyzed in T1DM and T2DM patients, respectively.In T1DM patients, blood glucose level was significantly higher in predinner than in prebreakfast and prelunch (all P < 0.01), and in postdinner 2 hour than in postlunch 2 hour (P = 0.021). The predinner blood level had no significant correlations with the blood glucose level at other time points and insulin dosages (all P > 0.05). In T2DM patients, the predinner blood glucose level was significantly higher in dusk phenomenon group than in suspicious group and nondusk phenomenon group (all P < 0.05). In dusk phenomenon group, the blood glucose level remained rising from predinner to prebed, and the predinner blood glucose level was only significantly correlated with postdinner 2-hour blood glucose level (P < 0.05).The ""dusk phenomenon"" (spontaneous and transient predinner hyperglycemia) is an objective existence in some patients with diabetes. The predinner hyperglycemia can affect blood glucose control between postdinner and prebed. Awareness of the ""dusk phenomenon"" has important clinical significance.

Insulin pump therapy in pregnancy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27582150/),"
Control of blood glucose during pregnancy is difficult because of wide variations, ongoing hormonal changes and mood swings. The need for multiple injections, pain at the injection site, regular monitoring and skillful handling of the syringes/pen further makes insulin therapy inconvenient. Insulin pump is gaining popularity in pregnancy because it mimics the insulin delivery of a healthy human pancreas. Multiple guidelines have also recommended the use of insulin pump in pregnancy to maintain the glycaemic control. The pump can release small doses of insulin continuously (basal), or a bolus dose close to mealtime to control the spike in blood glucose after a meal and the newer devices can shut down insulin delivery before the occurrence of hypoglycaemia. Pump insulin of choice is rapid acting analogue insulin. This review underscores the role of insulin pump in pregnancy, their usage, advantages and disadvantages in the light of existing literature and clinic experience.

Impact of insulin pump on quality of life of diabetic patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27366717/),"
Diabetes is an emerging health problem, both in developing and developed countries and has an enormous economic and social impact. The objective of our study was to find the impact of insulin pump on the quality of life of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and compare it to the quality of life of patients with T2D using an insulin pen.
This is a case-control study which was conducted among patients with T2D presenting between November 2014 and November 2015. A total of 83 patients with T2D, using insulin pump were enrolled in the study as cases and 322 patients with T2D not using insulin pump but using insulin pens were enrolled as controls. Short form-36 quality of life questionnaire was used for data collection.
Mean age of patients using insulin pump was 52.49 ± 9.28 while the mean age of patients not using insulin pump was 54.72 ± 16.87. Mean score of all domains in the questionnaire was found to be higher in patients using insulin pump as compared to patients not using insulin pumps (P < 0.05). In 81.1% of the patients, the insulin pump decreased the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes.
Insulin pump has significantly improved the quality of life of patients in terms of better self-esteem, decreased stress, and better mood. It has resulted in improved physical health, meal time flexibility, and ease of travel. It allows patient to have more active participation in social and recreational activities improving their personal and family life.

Insulin pump for the treatment of diabetes in combination with ulcerative foot infections.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27358133/),"
Ulcerative foot infection is a chronic complication frequently seen in diabetic patients, and can result in disability. To evaluate insulin pump treatment for type 2 diabetes in combination with ulcerative foot infection, we selected 168 diabetic patients who developed foot ulcers and received treatment from April 2012 to April 2014 in the Peoples Hospital of Zhengzhou, Henan, China. The patients were divided into a treatment group and a control group, 84 in each group. Besides anti-infection treatment, patients in the control group were given multiple subcutaneous insulin injection (MSII), while patients in the treatment group were given continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Ulcer area, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), C-reactive protein (CRP) and count of white blood cells (WBC) were recorded before treatment, one week after treatment, two weeks after treatment and four weeks after treatment; moreover, ulcer healing condition was recorded four weeks after treatment and the related factors were analyzed. Patients in the treatment group showed an obviously narrowed ulcer area two and four weeks after treatment (P less than 0.05) and significantly lowered levels of FPG, CRP and WBC in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd weeks after treatment (P less than 0.05); four weeks after treatment, 88.1% of patients in the treatment group and 66.7% in the control group had healed well, and the difference between two groups was statistically significant (χ2=5.509, P=0.019). Multi-factor logistic regression analysis indicated that levels of FPG, CRP and WBC at baseline and four weeks after treatment had a positive correlation to ulcer healing (P less than 0.05). All the above findings suggest that insulin pump can improve ulcer healing of patients suffering from diabetic foot ulcers as it effectively controls blood glucose level, restrains inflammatory reaction and prevents spreading of infection.

NOCTURNAL HYPOGLYCEMIA--THE MAIN INDICATION FOR INSULIN PUMP THERAPY IN ADULTHOOD.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27333724/),"
The aim was to determine which adult type 1 diabetic patient receiving multiple daily injection therapy is the most appropriate candidate for insulin pump therapy, while taking into consideration limited insulin pump affordability in Croatia. A total of 145 type 1 diabetic patients (52% diagnosed in adult age) were monitored at the Department of Endocrinology, Clinical Department of Internal Medicine, Zagreb University Hospital Center from 2009 to 2014. Twenty-one patients started insulin pump therapy in adulthood (seven men and 14 women, median age 27). Five patients had chronic complications (retinopathy in two, polyneuropathy in one, and both nephropathy and retinopathy in two patients). The median HbA1c at the initiation of pump therapy was 6.95% versus 6.5% after 1 year of pump therapy. Patients were stratified according to indications for insulin pump therapy (frequent and/or severe hypoglycemia, specific lifestyle, having not reached glycemic goals despite adherence/labile diabetes, and preconception). Patients could meet more than one criterion. Initially, the occurrence of hypoglycemia was analyzed by 6-day continuous glucose monitoring, while re-evaluation was done after collecting history data at 1 year ± 3 months. Initially, all patients had a median of 5 hypoglycemias/6 days (30% nocturnal) versus 1 hypoglycemia/6 days (without nocturnal) after 1 year. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test yielded a statistically significant difference in hypoglycemic events, nocturnal hypoglycemia and HbA1c. Patients commencing insulin pump therapy due to hypoglycemia initially had median HbA1c of 6.7% with 7 hypoglycemia/6 days (50% nocturnal). After one year, median HbA1c was 6% with 1 hypoglycemia/6 days (without nocturnal). In conclusion, the main indication for insulin pump therapy in adults is the frequency of hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal ones.

To assess the incidence of serious adverse events (AEs) of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with canagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor, as an add-on to insulin in adults with type 1 diabetes.
In this 18-week, randomized, double-blind, phase 2 study, patients (N = 351; HbA1c 7.0-9.0% [53-75 mmol/mol]) on multiple daily insulin injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion received canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg or placebo once daily. The incidence of ketone-related AEs, defined as any event from a prespecified list of preferred terms (i.e., acidosis, blood ketone body increased, blood ketone body present, DKA, diabetic ketoacidotic hyperglycemic coma, ketoacidosis, ketonemia, ketonuria, ketosis, metabolic acidosis, urine ketone body present), including serious AEs of DKA, was assessed based on AE reports.
At week 18, the incidence of any ketone-related AE with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg was 5.1% (n = 6 of 117) and 9.4% (n = 11 of 117), respectively; no patients in the placebo group experienced a ketone-related AE. The incidence of serious AEs of DKA was 4.3% (n = 5 of 117) with canagliflozin 100 mg and 6.0% (n = 7 of 117) with canagliflozin 300 mg; all serious events occurred in the presence of circumstances that are known to potentially precipitate DKA (e.g., infection, insulin pump failure). Among the 12 patients with a serious AE of DKA, blood glucose levels ranged from 9.4 to >44.4 mmol/L (170 to >800 mg/dL). Baseline characteristics were generally similar in patients with and without a ketone-related AE.
Canagliflozin was associated with an increased incidence of serious AEs of DKA in patients with type 1 diabetes inadequately controlled with insulin. Mitigation strategies are needed for use in future clinical trials to reduce the risk of DKA with canagliflozin treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Reasons for the discontinuation of therapy of personal insulin pump in children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26901138/),"
Pump discontinuation is rare. It is estimated that only about 4% of patients return to multiple daily injections (MDI).
To study the factors that influence the decision to stop continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII).
Analysis of the anonymous questionnaires indicating factors that influenced pump discontinuation and return to the MDI.
30 children (17girls), mean age 14.3yr(± 3,57), at the start of CSII 11.06yr(± 4.01), at discontinuation of pump therapy 13,23yr(±3,82).
The mean duration of pump usage was significantly higher in boys: 3.28yr±2.31 vs 1, 27yr±1.04(p=0.01); mean HbA1c: boys-8.03%±1.03, girls-7.78±1.42. The most frequently reported disconnection reasons were: greater sense of disease (93%), difficulties in doing sports (70%), worse well-being during pump therapy (63%), having to attach the pump to the body (60%), embarrassment (56%), adhesions and pain in the place of needle insertion (50%), difficulties in controlling glycemia during physical exercise, fear (43%), high levels of HbA1c (36%), frequent blood glucose monitoring (26%). Problems with technical operation of the pump or frequent episodes of severe hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis were not reported. Among those who indicated difficulty in controlling glycaemia during physical exercise or infection, the average age at the time of quitting the pump was significantly lower than the rest: 12.3±3.33 vs. 14.69 ±2.82 (p=0.04).
The individual psycho-emotional state of the child and appropriate education are important at the start and continuation of CSII.

There is a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring, compared to self-monitoring of blood glucose with test strips, when it comes to illness and mortality. More high-quality, controlled studies with a longer follow-up period are required for all patient groups with diabetes. Persons with diabetes are considerably more satisfied with continuous glucose monitoring, particularly in combination with insulin pump therapy (sensor-augmented pump therapy, SAP), than with modern therapy, which involves multiple daily injections and self-testing with test strips. Being satisfied with the treatment may be significant in terms of achieving better blood glucose control. There is limited or insufficient knowledge regarding the effect of continuous glucose monitoring, either alone or in combination with insulin pump therapy on quality of life, severe hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. The intervention cost of long-term use of continuous glucose monitoring is significantly higher compared to self-testing with a test strip. However, the additional cost is significantly lower if continuous glucose monitoring is only used for a short period, for example, to adjust insulin doses. As there is a lack of knowledge concerning the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring, it is not possible to assess its cost-effectiveness. The higher cost must be contrasted with the short- and long-term benefits from a well-functioning diabetes therapy. Individual assessment of suitable treatment is therefore warranted pending new studies. Although continuous glucose monitoring is used in Sweden, diabetes clinics are reluctant to offer the method, particularly to adults. It is used by few patients and predominantly for short periods, generally in patients with recurrent hypoglycaemia. For infants and children of pre-school age, continuous glucose monitoring can make life considerably easier, because they often need to take 10–15 blood glucose measurements per day. The most important measure for long-term glucose control is HbA1c. Poor glucose control is closely linked to diabetes complications. Therapy using continuous glucose monitoring improves HbA1c in the short term. This applies if the method is used consistently, i.e. a minimum of six days per week. Studies on SAP indicate additional improvement in HbA1c. If future studies with longer follow-up periods show continued improvement, the risk of diabetes complications would be reduced.

Insulin pumps for diabetes are commonly used today, especially in the treatment of children and adolescents. However, there is a considerable lack of knowledge regarding the effects of insulin pump therapy on illness and mortality. This lack of knowledge also extends to the use of insulin pumps in combination with continuous glucose monitoring, so called sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAP). More well-performed long-term studies of all patient groups with diabetes are required. People with diabetes are considerably more satisfied with SAP than with intensive injection therapy and self-monitoring of blood glucose with test strips. Being satisfied with the treatment may be important in terms of achieving better blood glucose control. Available knowledge is less clear when it comes to treat- ment satisfaction with insulin pumps only. There is limited or insufficient knowledge regarding the effect of insulin pumps or SAP on quality of life, ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemia. The intervention cost of insulin pump therapy is more per patient and year compared to injection therapy. For adults, insulin pumps are used predominantly when injection therapy fails to achieve the treatment goals; it is rarely the first-choice treatment. The higher cost must be contrasted with the short- and long-term benefits from a well-functioning diabetes therapy. Individual assessment is therefore warranted pending new studies. For children of preschool age, insulin pumps tend to be the first-choice treatment when diabetes is diagnosed. This can be particularly important when it is difficult to inject sufficiently small doses or there is fear of needles. The most important measure for long-term glucose control is HbA1c, which is also closely linked to diabetes complications. Insulin pump therapy has shown some improvement in HbA1c in the short term. Studies on SAP indicate additional improvement in HbA1c. If future studies with longer follow-up periods show continued improvement, the risk of diabetes complications would be reduced.

Clinical recommendations in the management of the patient with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy in the perioperative period: a primer for the anaesthetist.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26675948/),"
Insulin pump therapy is increasingly common in patients with type 1 diabetes. Many of these patients will require surgery at some point in their lifetime. Few doctors will have experience of managing these patients, and little evidence exists to assist in the development of guidelines for patients with insulin pump therapy, undergoing surgery.It is clear that during emergency surgery insulin pump therapy is not appropriate and should be discontinued, but patients undergoing some elective surgery can and should continue insulin pump therapy, without any adverse effect on their blood sugar control, or on the outcome of their surgery. Individual hospitals need to formalize guidance on the management of patients receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy, to allow patients the choice to continue their therapy during surgery. This expert opinion presents anaesthetists with a suggested clinical framework to help facilitate continued insulin pump therapy, during elective surgery and into the postoperative period.

[Monitoring of diabetes compensation in patients treated with an insulin pump in the Czech Republic].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26652964/),"
Insulin pump treatment (IP) is one of the ways of intensive insulin therapy, designed preferentially for patients with type 1 diabetes. The price of the treatment is higher than that of the conventional basalbolus and insulin regimens using repeated insulin application with a dose selector.
Quality assessment of IP therapy monitoring in patients with DM in a representative sample of the patient population with DM kept in the database of the General Health Insurance Company of the Czech Republic (VZP) which provided health care coverage for 63% of Czech population in 2014.
We identified all individuals in the VZP database who had a record of DM diagnosis (E10-E16 based on ICD 10) or who had any antidiabetic therapy prescribed (ATC group A10) in the period of 2009-2013. Over the whole period of 2009-2014 there were overall n=4,002 unique patients with DM identified in the VZP data, who were treated with IP within the assessment period. Incidence for the year 2014 (the newly treated with an insulin pump): all patients who had IP recorded in 2014 while in the preceding period of 2009-2013 they had no record of IP use. Prevalence for the year 2014 (all treated with an insulin pump): all the patients who for the period of 2010-2014 had at least once insulin pump use recorded and who did not die before 2014. Quality control parameters (HbA1c examination and consumption of glucose level test strips) for patients treated with IP were only assessed in detail for the year 2014, namely for all patients undergoing insulin pump treatment in 2014 throughout the year (i.e. from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2014), i.e. in n=3,189 patients in all.
In 2014 there were 247 incident patients and 3 794 prevalent patients. IP was newly introduced for almost 50% of the patients aged 20-39 years. In 2014 an average frequency of HbA1c examination equaled 3.38 per patient and 98.5% patients were examined for HbA1c at least once. An average consumption of glucose level testing strips per patient was 879 pieces.
The pilot project of assessment of quality parameters for IP therapy monitoring shows that the patients treated with IP have glycated hemoglobin checked quite frequently (3.38 checkups per patient in 2014) and they measure their blood glucose 2-3 times a day on average.

CSII as an Alternative Therapeutic Strategy for Managing Type 2 Diabetes: Adding the Indian Experience to a Global Perspective.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26643928/),"
Alternative insulin therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is offered with an objective of achieving better glycemic control, minimising glucose variability and thereby, preventing or reducing the risk of microvascular and macrovascular complications in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Trials conducted across the world have demonstrated that CSII is more beneficial in terms of achieving better metabolic control in type 2 diabetes. Unawareness about the multiple benefits of CSII is a major hurdle to its widespread use. In India, insulin pumps are more popular in type 2 diabetes and we have been deploying pumps since 2004. Previously, we have reported reduction in HbA1c, body weight and total daily dose of insulin in patients on insulin pump therapy (IPT).
The objective of this study was to assess the attitude and behavior of type 2 diabetes patients on IPT.
A cross sectional survey was conducted among selected type 2 diabetes patients who have been on IPT for more than 3 years. We administered questionnaires to assess level of satisfaction with pump, improvement in quality of life (QoL), use of the advanced functions and average cost incurred by being on pump. Difference in scores between males and females were assessed using chiquare test for proportions and t-test for differences in means.
Improvement in QoL after being on pump was appreciated by 92%. The level of satisfaction was rated as 'fully satisfied' by 52% of respondents while 26% found being on pump, 'satisfactory'. Ninety percent thought that the pump met their expectations.
The attitude and behavior of type 2 diabetes patients on IPT is positive and promising.

Unique Challenges of Type 1 Diabetes in the Preschool Population.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26490431/),"
Extremely young children aged ≤6 years old represent a unique population among patients with type 1 diabetes in terms of glycemic variation, diabetes management and complications.
We describe distinct features of diabetes care and outcomes in preschool age children.
We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and authors' bibliographies in order to extract articles specific to type 1 diabetes in preschool age children.
The preschool age group is beset by many challenges to diabetes care, including more frequent hypo- and hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, decreased residual beta cell function, and greater long-term neurocognitive effects from severe hypoglycemia and chronic hyperglycemia. Randomized controlled trials show that equally good metabolic control can be obtained with multiple daily injections or an insulin pump. Several non-randomized trials, including an 8 year longitudinal study, show lower hemoglobin A1C and decreased hypoglycemia on insulin pumps. Sensor augmented pump therapy resulted in superior A1C as long as sensors were used regularly. In contrast to adults, continuous glucose monitoring has little to no impact on A1C, although parents appreciate the improved monitoring for hypoglycemia. Children with onset of diabetes prior to age 5 are at risk for younger onset of microalbuminuria, however do not develop earlier onset retinopathy than children diagnosed after 5 years. Both severe hypoglycemia and chronic hyperglycemia have negative impact on neurocognition.
Special knowledge about this young population is helpful for practitioners and parents.

Interventions That Restore Awareness of Hypoglycemia in Adults With Type 1 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26207053/),"
Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia (SH) sixfold and affects 30% of adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D). This systematic review and meta-analysis looks at the educational, technological, and pharmacological interventions aimed at restoring hypoglycemia awareness (HA) in adults with T1D.
We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index Expanded, Social Sciences Citation Index, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from inception until 1 October 2014. Included studies described HA status at baseline. Outcome measures were SH rates, change in HA, counterregulatory hormone responses, and glycemic control.
Forty-three studies (18 randomized controlled trials, 25 before-and-after studies) met the inclusion criteria, comprising 27 educational, 11 technological, and 5 pharmacological interventions. Educational interventions included structured diabetes education on flexible insulin therapy, including psychotherapeutic and behavioral techniques. These were able to reduce SH and improve glycemic control, with greater benefit from the latter two techniques in improving IAH. Technological interventions (insulin pump therapy, continuous glucose monitoring, and sensor-augmented pump) reduced SH, improved glycemic control, and restored awareness when used in combination with structured education and frequent contact. Pharmacological studies included four insulin studies and one noninsulin study, but with low background SH prevalence rates.
This review provides evidence for the effectiveness of a stepped-care approach in the management of patients with IAH, initially with structured diabetes education in flexible insulin therapy, which may incorporate psychotherapeutic and behavioral therapies, progressing to diabetes technology, incorporating sensors and insulin pumps, in those with persisting need.

Fasting in Ramadan with an insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26013786/),"
A good majority of subjects with diabetes on insulin therapies observe fasting during Ramadan. The challenge for the physician and the patient is to manage diabetes without an interruption to fasting by avoiding hypoglycaemia and simultaneously ensuring that blood glucose remain at acceptable safe levels. Insulin Pumps differ from syringes and insulin pens in that it offers a variable basal rate, different type of boluses and associated calculators. The technological advances that pumps offer, help educated subjects pre-programme a reduced basal rate throughout the day. Pumps ensure avoidance of hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia and preserve quality of life and enhance confidence in patients during fasting. Due to multiple benefits, insulin pumps are considered the best delivery systems for insulin during the holy month of Ramadan, despite the prerequisites for its optimal output and cost concerns.

Tolerance of centrifuge-simulated suborbital spaceflight in subjects with implanted insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25945560/),"
With commercial spaceflight comes the possibility of spaceflight participants (SFPs) with significant medical conditions. Those with previously untested medical conditions, such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and the use of indwelling medical devices, represent a unique challenge. It is unclear how SFPs with such devices will react to the stresses of spaceflight. This case report describes two subjects with Type I DM using insulin pumps who underwent simulated dynamic phases of spaceflight via centrifuge G force exposure.
Two Type I diabetic subjects with indwelling Humalog insulin pumps, a 23-yr-old man averaging 50 u of Humalog daily and a 27-yr-old man averaging 60 u of Humalog daily, underwent seven centrifuge runs over 48 h. Day 1 consisted of two +Gz runs (peak = +3.5 Gz, run 2) and two +Gx runs (peak = +6.0 Gx, run 4). Day 2 consisted of three runs approximating suborbital spaceflight profiles (combined +Gx and +Gz). Data collected included blood pressure, electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, neurovestibular evaluation, and questionnaires regarding motion sickness, disorientation, greyout, and other symptoms. Neither subject experienced adverse clinical responses to the centrifuge exposure. Both maintained blood glucose levels between 110-206 mg Â· dl(-1).
Potential risks to SFPs with insulin pump dependent DM include hypo/hyperglycemia, pump damage, neurovestibular dysfunction, skin breakdown, and abnormal stress responses. A search of prior literature did not reveal any previous studies of individuals with DM on insulin pumps exposed to prolonged accelerations. These cases suggest that individuals with conditions dependent on continuous medication delivery might tolerate the accelerations anticipated for commercial spaceflight.

"Insulin pump risks and benefits: a clinical appraisal of pump safety standards, adverse event reporting, and research needs: a joint statement of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association Diabetes Technology Working Group.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25776138/),"
Insulin pump therapy, also known as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), is an important and evolving form of insulin delivery, which is mainly used for people with type 1 diabetes. However, even with modern insulin pumps, errors of insulin infusion can occur due to pump failure, insulin infusion set (IIS) blockage, infusion site problems, insulin stability issues, user error, or a combination of these. Users are therefore exposed to significant and potentially fatal hazards: interruption of insulin infusion can result in hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis; conversely, delivery of excessive insulin can cause severe hypoglycemia. Nevertheless, the available evidence on the safety and efficacy of CSII remains limited. The European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have therefore joined forces to review the systems in place for evaluating the safety of pumps from a clinical perspective. We found that useful information held by the manufacturing companies is not currently shared in a sufficiently transparent manner. Public availability of adverse event (AE) reports on the US Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database is potentially a rich source of safety information but is insufficiently utilized due to the current configuration of the system; the comparable database in Europe (European Databank on Medical Devices [EUDAMED]) is not publicly accessible. Many AEs appear to be attributable to human factors and/or user error, but the extent to which manufacturing companies are required by regulators to consider the interactions of users with the technical features of their products is limited. The clinical studies required by regulators prior to marketing are small and over-reliant on bench testing in relation to ""predicate"" products. Once a pump is available on the market, insufficient data are made publicly available on its long-term use in a real-world setting; such data could provide vital information to help health care teams to educate and support users and thereby prevent AEs. As well as requiring more from the manufacturing companies, we call for public funding of more research addressing clinically important questions in relation to pump therapy: both observational studies and clinical trials. At present, there are significant differences in the regulatory systems between the US and European Union at both pre- and postmarketing stages; improvements in the European system are more urgently required. This statement concludes with a series of recommended specific actions for ""meknovigilance"" (i.e., a standardized safety approach to technology) that could be implemented to address the shortcomings we highlight.

Consensus evidence-based guidelines for use of insulin pump therapy in the management of diabetes as per Indian clinical practice.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25668935/),"
The use of insulin pump in diabetes is likely to increase with recent advances in technology. Although the evidence for the superiority of pumps over multiple daily injections (MDI) is inconsistent, data from accumulating uncontrolled studies indicate greater reductions in glycated haemoglobin in patients switching to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) from MDI therapy. Due to the variability in insulin requirements and sensitivity to CSII pumps, hyperglycaemia in these patients is managed by endocrinologists using individualised therapy. A panel of experts reviewed the existing guidelines and framed recommendations specific to the clinical practice in Indian conditions for use of CSII pumps in the management of hyperglycaemia. Selection of right patient with basic education, motivation and learning skills are essential for successful implementation of CSII therapy with sophisticated programmes. Rapid acting insulin analogues with better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile, physical and chemical stability and compatibility with most commercially available insulin pumps are preferred over regular insulin to achieve safe and stable glycaemic control. Further, educating pump users on proper use of CSII pumps, insulin dose adjustments, and handling of accessories are recommended in the current consensus guidelines. Practice of self-monitoring of blood glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels are essential to adjust insulin dosage for the management of diabetes. Use of CSII pumps in special patient populations should be carefully assessed and initiated by endocrinologist. The proposed guidelines can form a basis for use of CSII pumps in the management of hyperglycaemia in the Indian scenario.

They were classified into two groups according to the (American Diabetes Association) ADA Hemoglobin A1c target (7.0%). Those reaching the target (n = 59) were compared with those failed (n = 49) using ANOVA and Logistic regression.
There were 75 females and 33 males with a median age of 32.0 (25.9-40.9) years and a median disease duration of 7.9(4.2-12.3) years. Logistic regression analysis revealed an odds ratio of 4.48(95%CI 1.53-13.15, P = 0.00) for total daily basal insulin dose within 0.2-0.3 units per kilogram, an OR of 1.31 (95%CI 1.05-1.63, P = 0.01) for self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and an OR of 3.43 (95%CI 1.18-10.01, P = 0.02) for males.

"Cognitive functioning, metabolic control, and treatment type in youth with type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25581746/),"
There is growing evidence that cognitive functioning plays an important role in self-care behavior and glycemic control in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. The aim of this pilot study was to examine whether there were differences in glycemic control and cognitive functioning between youth with T1D treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily injections.
The sample consisted of 29 youth diagnosed with type 1 diabetes ages 6-15 years (mean age=11.72 years) receiving care at an outpatient pediatric endocrinology clinic. Youth were administered the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence and Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning. Independent samples t-tests were used to compare youth with T1D treated with MDI vs. CSII on glycemic control, verbal memory, visual memory, attention/concentration, and intelligence.
Mean intelligence scores for the insulin pump sample were higher than the daily injection sample. This difference was a medium to large effect. After controlling for demographic variables, age of onset for diabetes, and glycemic control, treatment type was still a significant predictor of intelligence demonstrating that CSII was associated with higher intelligence scores.
The use of standardized measures of cognitive functioning in routine clinical care may shed some light on the complex interplay between cognitive functioning, treatment type, and glycemic control when managing pediatric patients with T1D.

Predicting the effectiveness of insulin pump therapy on glycemic control in clinical practice: a retrospective study of patients with type 1 diabetes from 10 outpatient diabetes clinics in Sweden over 5 years.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25470010/),"
Multicenter long-term studies of predictors for the effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in clinical practice are lacking. We hypothesized that there are substantially greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in patients with poor glycemic control and that other predictors may also exist.
We used data from 10 outpatient diabetic clinics in Sweden and studied CSII treatment over 5 years. Patients with HbA1c values available ≤ 6 months before starting CSII and at 5 years were included (n = 272, 82% of CSII patients) along with 2,437 contemporaneous controls on multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). Baseline variables evaluated were age, sex, diabetes duration, insulin dose, body mass index (BMI), HbA1c at baseline, and outpatient clinical care unit.
At 5 years, significantly greater reductions in HbA1c by CSII compared with MDI were found for patients with higher baseline HbA1c (P = 0.032) and lower baseline BMI (P = 0.013). For baseline HbA1c levels of 7.0%, 8.0%, and 9.0% and a BMI of 25 kg/m(2), the reduction in HbA1c level by CSII was 0.08% (difference not significant), 0.16% (95% confidence interval, 0.03-0.29%), and 0.25% (95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.39%), respectively. Corresponding analyses for the change in HbA1c level from start to 1 and 2 years revealed a significant interaction of insulin pump therapy only with baseline HbA1c levels (P < 0.001 and P = 0.030, respectively). The interaction term between outpatient clinical care unit and CSII treatment was statistically significant for some care units, with some care units demonstrating a benefit from CSII and others demonstrating a detriment.
Patients with high HbA1c levels have a greater probability of improved HbA1c after initiating pump therapy, but effects remain relatively modest even for patients with poor control. Factors predicting successful insulin pump use need further study.

To explore the insulin requirement profiles and analyze the related factors of type 2 diabetics on insulin pump therapy.
A total of 296 patients were admitted to hospital for 1-2 weeks of insulin pump therapy and received a diet of 25-30 kcal/kg ideal body weight per day. Insulin infusion was adjusted to achieve normoglycemia. It was defined as fasting capillary blood glucose of no more than 7.0 mmol/L and capillary blood glucose at 2 hours after each of three meals of no more than 10.0 mmol/L. After goal-reaching for 3 days, the insulin requirement profiles and related factors were analyzed.
The average time of achieving normoglycemia was (5.1 ± 2.9) days. The total daily insulin dose per kilogram was (0.80 ± 0.27) U/kg and the ratio of total basal insulin dose to total bolus insulin dose 40%: 60%. Patients with central obesity needed a higher ratio of total basal insulin dose to total daily insulin dose (P < 0.05). Associations existed between the ratio of total basal insulin dose to total daily insulin dose and disease duration, waist circumference and ratio of 2 hour-postprandial C-peptide to fasting C-peptide (r = 0.169, 0.143, -0.107, all P < 0.05). Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that waist circumference, disease duration and ratio of 2 hour-postprandial C-peptide to fasting C-peptide were independently related with the ratio of total basal insulin dose to total daily insulin dose. Also waist circumference, fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were independently associated with total daily insulin dose per kilogram.
The ratio of total basal insulin dose to total bolus insulin dose is 40%: 60% in Chinese type 2 diabetics with insulin pump therapy. And it is associated with central obesity level and β-cell function. Parameters indicating glycemic control and central obesity should be taken into consideration for total insulin requirements.

This study aims to determine HCP time spent in IPT patient care to inform resource planning for optimal IPT delivery.
Twenty-four Australian adult IPT-experienced institutions (14 government funded, seven private, three both) collected data between April 2012 and January 2013 prospectively, including: patient demographics, HCP classification, purpose of HCP-patient interaction, interaction mode and HCP time with the patient. A subset of patients was tracked from pre-pump education until stable on IPT.
Data on 2577 HCP-adult patient interactions (62% face-to-face, 29% remote, 9% administrative) were collected over 12.2 ± 6.4 weeks for 895 patients; age 35.4 ± 14.2 years; 67% female; 99% type 1 diabetes, representing 25% of all IPT patients of the institutions. Time (hours) spent on IPT interactions per centre per week were: nurses 5.4 ± 2.8, dietitians 0.4 ± 0.2 and doctors 1.0 ± 0.5. IPT starts accounted for 48% of IPT interaction time. The percentage of available diabetes clinic time spent on outpatient IPT interactions was 20.4%, 4.6% and 2.7% for nurses, dietitians and doctors respectively. Fifteen patients tracked from pre-pump to stabilisation over 11.8 ± 4.5 weeks, required a median (range) of 9.2 (3.0-20.9), 2.4 (0.5-6.0) and 1.8 (0.5-5.4) hours per patient from nurses, dietitians and doctors respectively.
IPT patient care represents a substantial investment in HCP time, particularly for nurses. Funding models for IPT care need urgent review to ensure this now mainstream therapy integrates well into healthcare resources.

"Type 1 diabetes, cardiovascular complications and sesame ( zhī má).",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24872931/),"
Diabetes is a major concern among medical practitioners, with the annual mortality rate increasing up to 26.9% in a person aged 65 years or older and 11.3% in the adult. There are many serious complications associated with diabetes, particularly cardiovascular complications due to microvascular diseases. A prerequisite to reduce the risk of microvascular and neurologic complications of type 1 diabetes is normoglycemia. Insulin therapy is the most common treatment used nowadays in type 1 diabetes. However, this method still has many disadvantages such as increased episode of severe hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, increased weight gain, transient exacerbation of pre-existing retinopathy, etc. Using insulin pump (the insulin pump is a medical device used for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion to manage the insulin level in the treatment of diabetes mellitus), is associated with known disadvantages including increased ketoacidosis, infection at the infusion site, and the treatment being less suitable in young children (less than 7 years of age). Therefore, alternative treatment for diabetes is still in great demand. We took the approach of traditional Chinese medicine to discuss this matter. Sesame ( Zhī Má), a herb, has been used medicinally for thousands of years in almost all the countries in the world. The beneficial effects of sesame in remediating diabetes, such as hypoglycemic effects, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypolipidemic effects, improving fat metabolism, and reducing cholesterol, have been demonstrated in many studies,. However, reports on the effects of sesame in remediating cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients are limited, which necessitates further studies on the effects of sesame on cardiovascular complications.

Efficacy of real-time continuous glucose monitoring on glycaemic control and glucose variability in type 1 diabetic patients treated with either insulin pumps or multiple insulin injection therapy: a randomized controlled crossover trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24816997/),"
The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of real-time continuous glucose monitoring in T1D patients treated with insulin pump therapy or multiple daily insulin therapy.
Twenty adult patients (ten insulin pump therapy and ten multiple daily insulin) with poor glycaemic control (HbA1c  > 8.0%) were randomized into two groups for 6 months: the continuous glucose monitoring arm (using real-time continuous glucose monitoring) and the SMBG arm. After 2 months of wash-out, the participants crossed over. The primary outcome was HbA1c reduction. The secondary outcomes were hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia risk assessment (area under the curve < 70 mg/dL/day and AUC > 200 mg/dL/day, respectively) and glucose variability.
Fourteen patients (eight multiple daily insulin, six insulin pump therapy) used continuous glucose monitoring appropriately (at least 40% of the time). In these patients, the improvement in glycaemic control was more evident during the real-time continuous glucose monitoring period (7.76% ± 0.4 vs 8.54% ± 0.4, p < 0.05) than during the self-monitoring of blood glucose period (8.42% ± 0.4 vs 8.56% ± 0.5, p = 0.2). Better results with continuous glucose monitoring were observed in patients using multiple daily insulin with greater improvement in both glycaemic control (7.71% ± 0.2 vs 8.58% ± 0.2, p < 0.05) and glucose variability and with a marked reduction in the risk of both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia.
Appropriate use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring improved glycometabolic control in T1D patients. The effects of continuous glucose monitoring were more evident in patients under multiple daily insulin treatment, compared with insulin pump therapy. Glucose variability, in addition to glycaemic control, was improved in compliant diabetic patients.

Frequency of morning ketosis after overnight insulin suspension using an automated nocturnal predictive low glucose suspend system.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24757229/),"
To assess the effect of overnight insulin pump suspension in an automated predictive low glucose suspend system on morning blood glucose and ketone levels in an attempt to determine whether routine measurement of ketone levels is useful when a closed-loop system that suspends insulin delivery overnight is being used.
Data from an in-home randomized trial of 45 individuals with type 1 diabetes (age range 15-45 years) were analyzed, evaluating an automated predictive low glucose pump suspension system in which blood glucose, blood ketone, and urine ketone levels were measured on 1,954 mornings.
One or more pump suspensions occurred during 744 of the 977 intervention nights (76%). The morning blood ketone level was ≥0.6 mmol/L after 11 of the 744 nights (1.5%) during which a pump suspension occurred and 2 of the 233 nights (0.9%) during which there was no suspension compared with 11 of 977 control nights (1.1%). The morning blood ketone level was ≥0.6 mmol/L after only 2 of 159 nights (1.3%) with a pump suspension exceeding 2 h. Morning fasting blood glucose level was not a good predictor of the presence of blood ketones.
Routine measurement of blood or urine ketones during use of an automated pump suspension system using continuous glucose monitoring, whether threshold based or predictive, is not necessary. Recommendations for checking ketone levels should be no different when a patient is using a system with automated insulin suspension than it is for conventional diabetes self-management.

Continuous subcutaneous infusion of protein C concentrate using an insulin pump in a newborn with congenital protein C deficiency.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24509341/),"
We describe the case of a newborn presenting with multicystic encephalomalacy, hydrocephalus and bilateral hemovitreous. An underlying coagulation disorder was suspected and laboratory tests revealed severe protein C deficiency. At 25 days of life, after the appearance of purpura fulminans, replacement therapy with intravenous protein C concentrate (Ceprotin; Baxter, Vienna, Austria) was started.Due to difficulties in getting peripheral venous access and to repeated loss of the venous access, continuous subcutaneous infusion of protein C was started with an insulin pump (VEO 754; Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA), normally adopted in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Protein C values increased into the normal range and the resolution of the purpuric skin lesion was achieved. Chronic prophylaxis with low-molecular-weight heparin failed and, due to cutaneous and cerebral recrudescence, replacement therapy with the pump was started again. The insulin pump allowed us to reduce the number of injections per day and to deal with the difficulties in getting peripheral venous access, permitting medical and paramedical staff an easier management of the therapy. The dosing schedule could be easily adapted with the insulin pump and the continuous subcutaneous administration of small amounts of protein C concentrate prevented fluctuation in trough levels of protein C. This is the first reported case of a novel, successful use of an insulin pump in an extremely rare disease, to administer a drug different from insulin, which needs to be further analyzed, underlining the importance of a multidisciplinary team approach in order to provide effective and efficient care in high-complexity diseases.

Insulin therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24458650/),"
Treatment of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) requires lifelong administration of exogenous insulin. The primary goal of treatment of T1DM in children and adolescents is to maintain near-normoglycemia through intensive insulin therapy, avoid acute complications, and prevent long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications, while facilitating as close to a normal life as possible. Effective insulin therapy must, therefore, be provided on the basis of the needs, preferences, and resources of the individual and the family for optimal management of T1DM. To achieve target glycemic control, the best therapeutic option for patients with T1DM is basal-bolus therapy either with multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Many formulations of insulin are available to help simulate endogenous insulin secretion as closely as possible in an effort to eliminate the symptoms and complications of hyperglycemia, while minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia secondary to therapy. When using MDI, basal insulin requirements are given as an injection of long- or intermediate-acting insulin analogs, while meal-related glucose excursions are controlled with bolus injections of rapid-acting insulin analogs. Alternatively, CSII can be used, which provides a 24-h preselected but adjustable basal rate of rapid-acting insulin, along with patient-activated mealtime bolus doses, eliminating the need for periodic injections. Both MDI treatment and CSII therapy must be supported by comprehensive education that is appropriate for the individual needs of the patient and family before and after initiation. Current therapies still do not match the endogenous insulin profile of pancreatic Î²-cells, and all still pose risks of suboptimal control, hypoglycemia, and ketosis in children and adolescents. The safety and success of a prescribed insulin regimen is, therefore, dependent on self-monitoring of blood glucose and/or a continuous glucose monitoring system to avoid critical hypoglycemia and glucose variability. Regardless of the mode of insulin therapy, doses should be adapted on the basis of the daily pattern of blood glucose, through regular review and reassessment, and patient factors such as exercise and pubertal status. New therapy options such as sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, which integrates CSII with a continuous glucose sensor, along with emerging therapies such as the artificial pancreas, will likely continue to improve safe insulin therapy in the near future.

[Insulin pump therapy: for whom and why?].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24163975/),"
Insulin pump therapy utilizes continuous infusion for the basic supply of insulin. As compared with multiple daily injections, pump therapy enables a clearly more precise targeting of the insulin therapy with respect to both time and quantity. This is important for insulin-sensitive patients such as small children, adults susceptible to hypoglycemia, or diabetics, whose blood glucose level exhibits a clear-cut elevation in the small hours (the dawn phenomenon). Also a diabetic with a high HbA1c and a good motivation for treatment may significantly benefit from the pump. Insulin pump therapy requires commitment to good self-monitoring from the diabetic patient.

Bolus calculator and wirelessly communicated blood glucose measurement effectively reduce hypoglycaemia in type 1 diabetic children - randomized controlled trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24115314/),"
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of bolus calculator function and wireless communication between insulin pump and blood glucose metre on metabolic control in children with type 1 diabetes, treated with insulin pumps.
In this randomized, controlled, 12-week trial, 156 patients, aged 12.9 ± 2.6 years, with a history of diabetes of 5.1 ± 3.3 years and glycated haemoglobin values of 7.3 ± 1.2% (56.3 ± 13.44 mmol/mol) were included. Children were assigned to one of three arms: group A, subjects using bolus calculator and wireless communication between insulin pump and blood glucose metre; group B, subjects using bolus calculator without communication between the devices and group C, control group. Devices were downloaded at 0, 6 and 12 weeks.
There were statistically fewer episodes of hypoglycaemia in children using bolus calculator compared with the control group: A versus C (3.8 ± 3.1 versus 7.8 ± 5.13 episodes/2 weeks, respectively, p < 0.0001); B versus C (3.6 ± 3.3 versus 7.8 ± 5.1 episodes/2 weeks, respectively, p < 0.0001). Patients in group A used bolus calculator function significantly more frequently than patients in group B (4.9 ± 3.4 versus 2.5 ± 2.9 times/24 h, respectively, p = 0.0006). No significant differences in glycated haemoglobin levels were found between the experimental and the control groups: group A versus C (p = 0.699). The use of bolus calculator did not influence post-prandial glycaemia, body mass index-SD score or insulin/kg/24 h.
Bolus calculator use reduces hypoglycaemic episodes independently of communication between insulin pump and blood glucose metre. Wireless communication between devices results in more frequent bolus calculator use.

[Does physical activity produce clinically significant changes during discontinuation of insulin pump in type 1 diabetic patients?].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24073947/),"
Discontinuation of insulin pump treatment (CSII) before, during and after physical activity is a common practice among a number of patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate the course of insulinemia during a 3- hour insulin pump suspension and after consecutive insulin bolus administration, and additionally, to assess the effect of physical activity (mid intensity aerobic exercise).
We enrolled 12 patients with diabetes mellitus type 1 in the study (men, mean age 33.4 ± 8.66 years, diabetes duration 16.3 ± 8.76 years, CSII treatment duration 6.9 ± 4.60 years, BMI 25.7 ± 3.75 mg/ m2, HbA1c 8.4 ± 0.95%, total insulin dose 50.3 ± 12.50 IU/ day). The tests were performed after night fasting at usual insulin doses, without serving breakfast and morning bolus dose. In the course of the test, insulin administration by a pump was suspended for 3 hours. Blood for assessment of blood glucose and insulinemia was taken in 30- minute intervals during the test. A test with or without physical exercise on bicycle ergometer was performed in each patient 2 weeks later.
We did not prove any influence of physical exercise on insulinemia during suspended insulin deli-very by an insulin pump. Insulinemia of approximately 50% of the original value persisted for another 90 minutes following insulin pump suspension. A rapid increase in insulinemia occurred after bolus administration in the 180th minute of the test. However, the decrease in blood glucose level did not occur until after another 90 minutes.
When modifying CSII treatment by reduction or suspension of insulin delivery it is essential to bear in mind the gradual decrease in insulinemia as well as the delay in insulin action following bolus administration.

Effect of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy and automated insulin suspension vs standard insulin pump therapy on hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes: a randomized clinical trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24065010/),"
Hypoglycemia is a critical obstacle to the care of patients with type 1 diabetes. Sensor-augmented insulin pump with automated low-glucose insulin suspension has the potential to reduce the incidence of major hypoglycemic events.
To determine the incidence of severe and moderate hypoglycemia with sensor-augmented pump with low-glucose suspension compared with standard insulin pump therapy.
A randomized clinical trial involving 95 patients with type 1 diabetes, recruited from December 2009 to January 2012 in Australia.
Patients were randomized to insulin pump only or automated insulin suspension for 6 months.
The primary outcome was the combined incidence of severe (hypoglycemic seizure or coma) and moderate hypoglycemia (an event requiring assistance for treatment). In a subgroup, counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia were assessed using the hypoglycemic clamp technique.
Of the 95 patients randomized, 49 were assigned to the standard-pump (pump-only) therapy and 46 to the low-glucose suspension group. The mean (SD) age was 18.6 (11.8) years; duration of diabetes, 11.0 (8.9) years; and duration of pump therapy, 4.1 (3.4) years. The baseline rate of severe and moderate hypoglycemic events in the pump-only group was 20.7 vs 129.6 events per 100 patient months in the low-glucose suspension group. After 6 months of treatment, the event rates decreased from 28 to 16 in the pump-only group vs 175 to 35 in the low-glucose suspension group. The adjusted incidence rate per 100 patient-months was 34.2 (95% CI, 22.0-53.3) for the pump-only group vs 9.5 (95% CI, 5.2-17.4) for the low-glucose suspension group. The incidence rate ratio was 3.6 (95% CI, 1.7-7.5; Pâ€‰<.001). There was no change in glycated hemoglobin in either group: mean, 7.4 (95% CI, 7.2-7.6) to 7.4 (95% CI, 7.2-7.7) in the pump-only group vs mean, 7.6 (95%, CI, 7.4-7.9) to 7.5 (95% CI, 7.3-7.7) in the low-glucose suspension group. Counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia were not changed. There were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemia with ketosis.
Sensor-augmented pump therapy with automated insulin suspension reduced the combined rate of severe and moderate hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) management requires year-round adherence to treatment regimen. Holidays may present a challenge towards achieving good metabolic control.
Our aim was to investigate the effect of holidays on diabetes management of schoolchildren with T1D.
Observational, case-crossover study of 45 schoolchildren, age range 7-19 years, mean 13.2 ± 3.4 years, followed in a pediatric diabetes clinic. Subjects were stratified by age [<12 years (n=21), >12 years (n=24)] and treatment modality [insulin pump (n=29) or multiple daily injections (n=16)]. Data were downloaded from glucometers and insulin pumps during five non-weekend holidays and five subsequent school days.
The mean number of blood glucose (BG) readings was significantly lower (4.4 ± 1.9 vs. 4.8 ± 1.9, p<0.01) and mean BG marginally higher (11.4 ± 2.7 vs. 10.7 ± 3.1 mmol/L, p=0.1) during holidays than during school days in the entire cohort. Children were significantly more adherent to diabetes management than adolescents as expressed by lower mean glycated hemoglobin level (7.7 ± 0.8% vs. 8.6 ± 1.4%, p<0.05), more BG readings per day (p<0.001) and lower mean BG on holidays (p<0.05) and on school days (p<0.01). In pump users, no difference in the mean number of boluses per day and mean insulin units per kilogram per day was observed between holidays and school days.
The management of school-aged children with T1D during holidays was worse than during school days; these finding were more pronounced in adolescents. The diabetes team should be aware of suboptimal therapy during holidays and should consider intervention programs in attempts to educate patients accordingly.

Clinical update on insulin pump therapy in combination with continuous glucose monitoring.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23732368/),"
In recent years, the treatment of type 1 diabetes has changed significantly. An important diagnostic and therapeutic support tool is the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) showing its best performance when used in combination with an insulin pump therapy. Before the availability of CGM the consideration of glucose regulation and therapeutic success was based solely on selectively measured blood glucose levels and HbA1c. In contrast to the blood glucose measurements CGM measures in the interstitial fluid and opens a new dimension of diabetes therapy, we call it ""glucose dynamics"". The knowledge of the continuous glucose course and its trends has proved to be a highly relevant additional parameter which in practical terms has a particularly stabilizing influence on blood glucose profiles. CGM therefore offers the option of a fine-tuning of metabolic control by experienced heath care professionals and the patient, making blood glucose control in general and unplanned activities and problems in everyday life better controllable. However, despite the tremendous potential of CGM in combination with a pump therapy the basic settings of an effective pump therapy are crucial. Particularly the right basal insulin coverage as the first step is the key issue for success. With support of CGM there is an enormous potential to facilitate the adjustment and optimization of insulin pump therapy.

Hacking medical devices a review - biomed 2013.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23686179/),"
Programmable, implantable and external biomedical devices (such as pacemakers, defibrillators, insulin pumps, pain management pumps, vagus nerve stimulators and others) may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, commonly referred to as hacking. This intrusion may lead to compromise of confidential patient data or loss of control of the device itself, which may be deadly. Risks to health from unauthorized access is in addition to hazards from faulty (buggy) software or circuitry. Historically, this aspect of medical device design has been underemphasized by both manufacturers and regulatory bodies until recently. However, an insulin pump was employed as a murder weapon in 2001 and successful hacking of an implantable defibrillator was demonstrated in 2008. To remedy these problems, professional groups have announced a variety of design standards and the governmental agencies of several countries have enacted device regulations. In turn, manufacturers have developed new software products and hardware circuits to assist biomedical engineering firms to improve their commercial offerings. In this paper the author discusses these issues, reviewing known problems and zero-day threats, with potential solutions. He outlines his approach to secure software and hardware challenges using the Forth language. A plausible scenario is described in which hacking of an implantable defibrillator by terrorists results in a severe national security threat to the United States.

Clinical factors affecting the perception of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes patients treated with personal insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23540230/),"
The ability to perceive the symptoms of hypoglycemia during the early decrease in plasma glucose concentration may be critical for the safety of T1DM patients treated with intensive insulin therapy, including those treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). In the presented observational study an attempt was made to asses clinical factors that might affect subjective awareness of hypoglycemia in CSII-treated T1DM patients, with special attention to factors specific for this mode of treatment.
For the purpose of the study, data of 110 CSII-treated T1DM patients were collected (78 females and 32 males). The records were analyzed from glucose meters (200-300 measurements/download, depending on meter type) and insulin pumps (total insulin dose, basal/bolus ratio, number of boluses/day, bolus calculator and dual wave/square bolus usage, continuous glucose monitoring data) from the last 3 years.
It was found that the level of subjective hypoglycemia perception inversely correlated with the number of hypoglycemic episodes per 100 measurements, age, duration of diabetes, time on insulin pump, and positively correlated with mean glycemia (n = 98; r = 0.22; p = 0.0286). With respect to CSII-related factors, hypoglycemia perception inversely correlated with the percentage of basal insulin (n = 106; r = -0.20; p = 0.0354). In stepwise regression analysis, independent predictors for impaired hypoglycemia perception were: age β = -0.29 (p = 0.023), duration of diabetes β = -0.24 (p = 0.029) and number of the hypoglycemia episodes for 100 measurements β = -0.33 (p = 0.0005).
Risk factors for impaired hypoglycemia perception in CSII-treated patients include those identified previously for the general population of T1DM individuals. In addition, the presented results suggest that a higher basal/bolus ratio may lead to impairment of the ability to perceive early symptoms of hypoglycemia.

Nocturnal glucose control with an artificial pancreas at a diabetes camp.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23445093/),"
Recent studies have shown that an artificial-pancreas system can improve glucose control and reduce nocturnal hypoglycemia. However, it is not known whether such results can be replicated in settings outside the hospital.
In this multicenter, multinational, randomized, crossover trial, we assessed the short-term safety and efficacy of an artificial pancreas system for control of nocturnal glucose levels in patients (10 to 18 years of age) with type 1 diabetes at a diabetes camp. In two consecutive overnight sessions, we randomly assigned 56 patients to receive treatment with an artificial pancreas on the first night and a sensor-augmented insulin pump (control) on the second night or to the reverse order of therapies on the first and second nights. Thus, all the patients received each treatment in a randomly assigned order. The primary end points were the number of hypoglycemic events (defined as a sensor glucose value of <63 mg per deciliter [3.5 mmol per liter] for at least 10 consecutive minutes), the time spent with glucose levels below 60 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per liter), and the mean overnight glucose level for individual patients.
On nights when the artificial pancreas was used, versus nights when the sensor-augmented insulin pump was used, there were significantly fewer episodes of nighttime glucose levels below 63 mg per deciliter (7 vs. 22) and significantly shorter periods when glucose levels were below 60 mg per deciliter (P=0.003 and P=0.02, respectively, after adjustment for multiplicity). Median values for the individual mean overnight glucose levels were 126.4 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 115.7 to 139.1 [7.0 mmol per liter; interquartile range, 6.4 to 7.7]) with the artificial pancreas and 140.4 mg per deciliter (interquartile range, 105.7 to 167.4 [7.8 mmol per liter; interquartile range, 5.9 to 9.3]) with the sensor-augmented pump. No serious adverse events were reported.
Patients at a diabetes camp who were treated with an artificial-pancreas system had less nocturnal hypoglycemia and tighter glucose control than when they were treated with a sensor-augmented insulin pump. (Funded by Sanofi and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01238406.).

This study investigated insulin pump therapy in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes and Turkish origin compared with those without migration background in Germany.
Using a nationwide documentation program, we estimated the prevalence of insulin pump therapy in patients < 20 years of age with Turkish origin and those without migration background. Logistic regression was used to adjust for age, sex, diabetes duration, body mass index SD score (BMI-SDS), glycated hemoglobin, number of outpatient visits, number of daily blood glucose self-measurements, and area-based socioeconomic conditions.
In 1,695 pediatric type 1 diabetes patients with Turkish background and 19,802 patients without migration background (respectively: 51.2% and 53.0% boys; mean age, 12.4 ± 4.1 and 12.6 ± 4.2 years; mean diabetes duration, 4.7 ± 3.9 and 5.3 ± 4.0 years), fully adjusted prevalences of insulin pump therapy were 18.5% and 30.9%, respectively (odds ratio 0.51, 95% confidence interval 0.43-0.60, P < 0.001). Age, sex, BMI-SDS, outpatient visits, and blood glucose self-control were significantly associated with the prevalence of insulin pump therapy but did not alter the difference substantially.
The prevalence of insulin pump therapy is roughly half among pediatric diabetes patients with Turkish background compared with those without migration background. Several covariates could not explain this difference. Individual characteristics or access barriers within the healthcare system may play a role. Further research is needed.

Efficacy and safety of insulin pump treatment in adult T1DM patients--influence of age and social environment.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23020059/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via personal insulin pump is a valuable therapeutic tool in T1DM patients. However, adherence to recommended CSII-related behaviours may be of concern to young adults with intensive, variable daily activities (students, young professionals). The aim of this observational study was to estimate treatment outcomes in young adult patients with T1DM, and compare them with older individuals.
Overall, 140 adults with T1DM on CSII were examined, divided into 2 subgroups: 77 patients younger than 26 years of age (mean 20.6 years) and 63 older subjects (mean 39.0). We compared the glycaemic control in both groups of T1DM subjects and analyzed treatment attitudes to identify potentially modifiable behaviours influencing the efficacy of the treatment.
The younger individuals were characterized by significantly worse treatment outcomes, compared to the older ones: the mean HbA1c levels were 7.6 ± 1.3% and 6.9±1.3% (p=0.00001), while the mean glucose levels based on glucometer downloads were 161±33.6 mg/dL and 136±21.8 mg/dL (p=0.00001), respectively. The frequency of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) was lower in younger individuals (5.3±2.1 vs. 7.0±2.8 daily, p=0.0005, respectively); they were also less frequently used advanced pump functions, e.g. the bolus calculator (48% vs. 67% users, p=0.0014, respectively).
The efficacy of CSII treatment observed in young T1DM adults was worse than in older patients. The reason for this phenomenon remains unclear, it may be due simply to age-dependend behaviours, to social environment, or both.

Deprivation and/or ethnicity impact on care delivery. We have assessed how these factors influence diabetes care in a paediatric clinic.
We related access to care [type of insulin treatment regimen-twice daily, multiple daily injections and insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion)], measures of care process (HbA(1c)) and an approximate measure of satisfaction with the service (clinic attendance rate) in 325 (170 male) children and young people with Type 1 diabetes (mean age 10.6 years, mean duration of diabetes of 4.5 years), with indices of deprivation and ethnicity.
Of the 325 children and young people, 2.7% received twice-daily insulin, 48.4% multiple daily injections and 48.9% continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Median clinic HbA(1c) was 62 mmol/mol (7.8%) and those receiving the insulin pump therapy had the lowest HbA(1c). Four ethnic groups were represented; White British 81.6%, Asian non-Indian 6.5%, African 8.1% and Asian Indian 3.8%. Mean deprivation score was 21.06. White British and Asian Indian groups were more likely to receive insulin pump therapy (χ(2) = 50.3; P < 0.001). Attendance rates were 94.1% and did not differ across ethnic groups. Deprivation was related to ethnicity and HbA(1c) (R(2) = 0.02; P = 0.02). There was no relationship between clinic attendance and deprivation. Insulin regimen and ethnicity were associated with HbA(1c) (R(2) = 0.096; P < 0.001). Similar findings were obtained when analysis was confined to the White British population.
These data suggest that deprivation and ethnicity influence diabetes control and how intensive insulin therapy is utilized. A better consideration of the needs of different ethnic groups is required to ensure equitable care delivery in paediatric diabetes.

This was a retrospective observational study which included 131 patients with T1DM who transitioned to an insulin pump from multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections between 1999 and 2009 and were followed by one endocrinologist. Data were collected from 6 months prior to switching to CSII to 30 months after initiation of CSII and included glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin requirement. Of the 131 patients, 45 had complete data consisting of a visit and HbA1c every 6 months for 30 months after transition to CSII and were included for analysis.
Mean HbA1c prior to starting the CSII was 8.0 +0.9 %, 7.7 +1.0 % at 6 months and 7.8+1.2 % at 1 yr post initiation of CSII. However, at 30 months, HbA1c increased to 8.0+1.3%. A trend in transient improvement in HbA1c was limited only to those patients >11 yr of age and those requiring >0.75 u/kg/day of insulin at transition and was not seen in those <11 yr of age or those requiring <0.75 u/kg/day and did not persist beyond 1 year.
There was no long-term significant difference in glycemic control in patients with CSII as compared to MDI.

Use of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes after failure of multiple daily injections.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22982794/),"
To determine the effectiveness of insulin pump use (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion; CSII) in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) who have failed multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy.
In this retrospective study, charts of patients with DM2 who were started on CSII after failure of MDI were reviewed. Patients were categorized as primarily manual (fixed) bolus users or calculated (using pump software) bolus users. The change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), weight, and basal insulin dose from baseline to 6 months was determined.
Fifty-seven patients (20 men and 37 women) ranging in age from 13 to 71 were identified in the study. A significant reduction in HbA1c was observed from 8.75 to 7.69% (P<.001). There was an increase in body mass index (BMI) from a mean of 36.53 to a mean of 37.21. A decrease in basal insulin requirement per kilogram of weight (-0.10 U/kg) was noted (P = .03). Seven patients using U-500 insulin in the pump also had a significant decrease in HbA1C of 1.1 % (P<.001), along with a 0.071 U/kg drop in basal insulin requirements (P<.001). When comparing calculated bolus users to manual bolus users, there was no difference in HbA1C improvement (P = .58).
We found that CSII improves glucose control in patients with DM2 who have failed MDI despite a decrease in overall insulin requirements. This includes patients with severe insulin resistance using U-500 insulin. Use of frequent bolus adjustment incorporating carbohydrate counting and current glucose level does not appear to be required for this benefit.

Insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22966100/),"
Insulin pump therapy makes use of an external device to deliver insulin continuously from a refillable storage reservoir by means of a cannula placed under the skin. A pump is intended to simulate pancreatic function in that it can be programmed to deliver an adjustable basal rate of insulin throughout the day, with higher infusion rates triggered by the push of a button at meal times or to correct a high blood glucose fluctuation. Insulin pumps have been mainly used in patients with type 1 diabetes. There are a number of recent technological innovations that support a more sophisticated approach to insulin dosing using insulin pumps.3 In this article we provide an overview of the use of such therapy.

Synthesis of insulin pump controllers from safety specifications using Bayesian model validation.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22961455/),"
Insulin pump controllers seek to alleviate the chronic suffering caused by diabetes that affects over 6% of the world population. The design of control laws for insulin pump controllers has been well studied. However, the parameters involved in the control law are difficult to synthesize. Traditionally, ad hoc approaches using animal models and random sampling have been used to construct these parameters. We suggest a synthesis algorithm that uses Bayesian statistical model validation to reduce the number of simulations needed. We apply this algorithm to the problem of insulin pump controller synthesis using in silico simulation of the glucose-insulin metabolism model.

Quality of life and technology: impact on children and families with diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22903783/),"
Ensuring quality of life (QOL) while maintaining glycemic control within targets is an important challenge in type 1 and type 2 diabetes treatment. For children with diabetes, QOL includes enjoying meals, feeling safe in school, and perceiving positive, supportive relationships with parents, siblings, and friends. Yet many treatment-related and psychosocial barriers can interfere with a child's QOL and their ability to manage diabetes effectively. Diabetes management also imposes considerable lifestyle demands that are difficult and often frustrating for children to negotiate at a young age. Recent advances in diabetes medications and technologies have improved glycemic control in children with diabetes. Two widely used technologies are the insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. These technologies provide patients with more flexibility in their daily life and information about glucose fluctuations. Several studies report improvements in glycemic control in children with type 1 diabetes using the insulin pump or sensor-augmented pump therapy. Importantly, these technologies may impact QOL for children and families with diabetes, although they are rarely used or studied in the treatment of children with type 2 diabetes. Further, emerging closed loop and web- and phone-based technologies have great potential for supporting diabetes self-management and perhaps QOL. A deeper understanding and appreciation of the impact of diabetes technology on children's and parents' QOL is critical for both the medical and psychological care of diabetes. Thus, the purpose of this review is to discuss the impact of new diabetes technologies on QOL in children, adolescents and families with type 1 diabetes.

Outpatient assessment of determinants of glucose excursions in adolescents with type 1 diabetes: proof of concept.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22853720/),"
Abstract   Objective: Controlled inpatient studies on the effects of food, physical activity (PA), and insulin dosing on glucose excursions exist, but such outpatient data are limited. We report here outpatient data on glucose excursions and its key determinants over 5 days in 30 adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) as a proof-of-principle pilot study.
Subjects (20 on insulin pumps, 10 receiving multiple daily injections; 15±2 years old; diabetes duration, 8±4 years; hemoglobin A1c, 8.1±1.0%) wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an accelerometer for 5 days. Subjects continued their existing insulin regimens, and time-stamped insulin dosing data were obtained from insulin pump downloads or insulin pen digital logs. Time-stamped cell phone photographs of food pre- and post-consumption and food logs were used to augment 24-h dietary recalls for Days 1 and 3. These variables were incorporated into regression models to predict glucose excursions at 1-4 h post-breakfast.
CGM data on both Days 1 and 3 were obtained in 57 of the possible 60 subject-days with an average of 125 daily CGM readings (out of a possible 144). PA and dietary recall data were obtained in 100% and 93% of subjects on Day 1 and 90% and 100% of subjects on Day 3, respectively. All of these variables influenced glucose excursions at 1-4 h after waking, and 56 of the 60 subject-days contributed to the modeling analysis.
Outpatient high-resolution time-stamped data on the main inputs of glucose variability in adolescents with T1D are feasible and can be modeled. Future applications include using these data for in silico modeling and for monitoring outpatient iterations of closed-loop studies, as well as to improve clinical advice regarding insulin dosing to match diet and PA behaviors.

Comparative effectiveness and safety of methods of insulin delivery and glucose monitoring for diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22777524/),"
Patients with diabetes mellitus need information about the effectiveness of innovations in insulin delivery and glucose monitoring.
To review how intensive insulin therapy (multiple daily injections [MDI] vs. rapid-acting analogue-based continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) or method of monitoring (self-monitoring of blood glucose [SMBG] vs. real-time continuous glucose monitoring [rt-CGM]) affects outcomes in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus.
MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through February 2012 without language restrictions.
33 randomized, controlled trials in children or adults that compared CSII with MDI (n=19), rt-CGM with SMBG (n=10), or sensor-augmented insulin pump use with MDI and SMBG (n=4).
2 reviewers independently evaluated studies for eligibility and quality and serially abstracted data.
In randomized, controlled trials, MDI and CSII showed similar effects on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels and severe hypoglycemia in children or adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus and adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus, HbA1c levels decreased more with CSII than with MDI, but 1 study heavily influenced these results. Compared with SMBG, rt-CGM achieved a lower HbA1c level (between-group difference of change, 0.26% [95% CI, 0.33% to 0.19%]) without any difference in severe hypoglycemia. Sensor-augmented insulin pump use decreased HbA1c levels more than MDI and SMBG did in persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus (between-group difference of change, 0.68% [CI, 0.81% to 0.54%]). Little evidence was available on other outcomes.
Many studies were small, of short duration, and limited to white persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and MDI have similar effects on glycemic control and hypoglycemia, except CSII has a favorable effect on glycemic control in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. For glycemic control, rt-CGM is superior to SMBG and sensor-augmented insulin pumps are superior to MDI and SMBG without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia.

Insulin pump treatment in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22728614/),"
Within children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes insulin pump treatment is of increasing interest. Frequency of insulin pump therapy shows a rapid and steep increase in toddlers and young children. Insulin pumps allow a close to physiologic insulin delivery due to basal rates programmed over 24 hours with circadian rhythms taken into account. Furthermore, another advantage of technical devices as insulin pumps is the application of extremely small amounts of insulin, as needed in very young children, with the possibility of titration of infusion rates down to 0.01E/h. Dawn Phenomenon and hypoglycemic events are main indications for insulin pump treatment in children and adolescents. A significant reduction of severe hypoglycemia, especially nocturnal hypoglycemia was shown, whereas a reduction of HbA1c and an improvement of metabolic control has been reported in short term and in some but not all long term studies. Ketoacidosis rate did not increase in insulin pump therapy. Complications due to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, like local infections and dermatological changes are frequent but were not associated with glycemic control and did not lead to discontinuation of insulin pump treatment. Pump discontinuation rate in general is low, varying from 1% in very young children up to 6% in pubertal adolescent girls. Insulin pump treatment was shown to be safe and efficient and the simplicity of handling the devices as well as an improvement of quality of life may explain the rapid increase of pump treatment in young children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

[Quality of treatment in children with type 1 diabetes based on the Polish Prospective Pump Programme].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22516770/),"
In pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the value of HbA1c is a predictor of the risk of late systemic complications in adulthood. In the last years significant changes in the method of treatment in pre-pubertal children with T1DM have taken place. However, there is lack of precise data concerning the results of metabolic control of this group of patients.
was to assess the impact of the Polish Prospective Insulin Pump Programme (OPPLP) on the quality of metabolic control in prepubertal children with T1DM. The OPPLP included also education for diabetological staff (HPC) from the Polish Diabetic Centres as well as standardization of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) implementation procedures.
Population studies were conducted in the years: 2005-2008. 920 patients were enrolled at age from 1.2 to 14.6 years (median 8.5 years). 71.75 % of patients were in pre-pubertal age. 734 patients received CSII therapy. The cross sectional, prospective study, conducted according to the protocol of the OPPLP with clinical data collection from 2005 to 2008. We analyzed the data obtained during 1657 visits and assessed 1657 blood samples for HbA1c value in the Central Laboratory. The clinical data were recorded in the electronic net-database.
In whole group the median of HbA1c was 7.46 % (min. 5% - max. 12.1%); 60.1% patients has HbA1c below 7.5%. The quality of treatment was comparable among the centres: med. HbA1c ranged from min. 6.5% to max. 8.0%. During the period from 2005 to 2008 effective results were obtained in glycemic control: med. HbA1c: 2005 - 7.6%, 2006 - 7.2%, 2007 - 7.0% and 2008 - 7.5%. Slightly higher HbA1c was observed in children with longer duration of diabetes (r=0.17, p<0.005).
The OPPLP, including HCP education, enabled optimalization of metabolic control in the prepubertal children switched pump therapy. Moreover, the programme brought about an even level of treatment between the Polish Diabetic Centres irrespective of their size. It is important to continue the programme and to develop a country level register of children with T1DM.

The paper brings an overview of published systematic reviews and meta-analyses concerning the evaluation of the effectiveness of the treatment with insulin pump (CSII) in comparison with multiple daily injections (MDI) in type 1 diabetes mellitus. According to found works CSII leads to slightly lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus against MDI. The levels of HbA1c and the variability of glycaemia during the day on MDI before an initiation of CSII should serve for the prediction of an effect of CSII in particular patient. Type 1 diabetics on CSII have less often hypoglycaemia, higher flexibility of their daily regime and thus higher satisfaction with their treatment against MDI. The daily doses of insulin decrease. The weight of patients is the same or slightly higher after the initiation of CSII. There were not enough information for the assesment of the frequency of adverse reactions. It is necessary to educate each patient not only how to manipulate the particular insulin pump, but also about general recommendations for the treatment of diabetes and the application of insulin.

Toddlers' choice: Yo-Yoing diabetes control or deci-unit insulin dosing?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22375164/),"
While the incidence of toddlers' diabetes is soaring, their mainstay insulins were withdrawn, namely the weak 10% or 20% insulin mixtures (WIM), which were injected only once or twice daily. Consequently, toddlers are coerced to use an insulin pump, multi-dose insulin regime (MuDIR), mix or dilute insulins. This paper highlights the difficulties and proposes a simple solution. While an insulin pump is the best available option, it is not readily available for everyone. Mixing insulins is not sufficiently precise in small doses. Although diluting insulin would allow precise dosing and reduce the dose variability secondary to dribbling after injections, it, like insulin mixing, deprives children from using the pen and related child-friendly accessories. In MuDIR, we inject 4-5 small doses of insulin instead of 1-2 daily larger doses of WIM. Thus, on using a half unit (½unit) insulin pen, a dose of 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 units are adjusted in steps of 100%, 50%, 33% or 25%; unlike the advisable 5%-20%. This does not easily match the tiny erratic meals of grazing toddlers. Maternal anxiety peaks on watching yo-yoing glycemia. Carers have to accept either persistently high sugar or wild fluctuation. The risks of such poor glycemic pattern are increasingly recognized. Using insulin U20 in a ½unit disposable pen allows deci-unit dosing, with 5%-20% dose-tuning, greater accuracy on delivering small doses and reduction of dose variability from dribbling. Deci-unit dosing may help avoid wide glycemic swings and provide the affordable alternative to insulin pumps for toddlers. Deci-unit pen materializes the Human Rights of Children, a safer and effective treatment.

"Advances in pump technology: insulin patch pumps, combined pumps and glucose sensors, and implanted pumps.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22208717/),"
This review discusses the most recent developments in insulin pump technology. The benefits of the insulin pump to patients with type 1 diabetes are recognized both for its metabolic effectiveness and its positive effects on quality of life. The current pumps are reliable, small and light, and are becoming more and more sophisticated. Nevertheless, there remain practical and psychological constraints for the patient. However, recent patch-pump advances should simplify the technical aspects of pump treatment and enhance patient comfort. Another advance combines the insulin pump with a glucose sensor. Such a combination is logical for optimizing pump use and, to that end, developing an automated or 'closed-loop'system that permits the delivery of subcutaneous insulin adjusted according to measured levels of subcutaneous glucose. Finally, implanted insulin pumps have proven their worth not only because of their simple use, but also for their contribution in the artificial pancreas project. Indeed, the prompt response with intraperitoneal administration of insulin makes it of interest for use in a closed-loop system.

External insulin pump treatment in the day-to-day management of diabetes: benefits and future prospectives.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22208709/),"
The aim of diabetes treatment is to achieve tight glucose control to avoid the development of chronic diabetes complications while reducing the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes. The main clinical indications of pump therapy in type 1 diabetes are persistently elevated HbA(1c) in spite of the best attempts of intensified insulin therapy with multiple daily injections (MDI) and/or frequent, disabling or severe hypoglycaemia. Several trials have demonstrated the superiority of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) over MDI, and highlighted the benefits of using short-acting insulin analogues. However, new MDI regimens with long-acting insulin analogues challenge insulin pump therapy in some indications, thus indicating the need for precise selection of those patients who will benefit the most from CSII. In type 2 diabetes, pump therapy may be an invaluable tool in selected patients characterized by chronic elevation of HbA(1c), obesity and high insulin requirements. In addition, in any case, specific education, training and ongoing evaluation of the benefit/risk ratio of the treatment are mandatory. Furthermore, there is continuing progress in the development of pump and catheter features, and insulin kinetics can still be improved. These technical advances are part of the work in progress towards developing closed-loop systems.

The effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin pumps with continuous glucose monitoring in outpatient adolescents with type 1 diabetes: A systematic review.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27820140/),"
The review question is: Are metabolic outcomes improved in outpatient adolescents (aged 13 to 19 years) with type 1 diabetes on a Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) when continuous glucose monitoring is used, compared to self-glucose monitoring alone?
Type 1 diabetes is the most common childhood paediatric disease, characterised by impairment of insulin producing βeta-cells in the pancreas. Internationally, there is variation in the incidence of type 1 diabetes in paediatric patients. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Study Group, the overall incidence rate of this autoimmune disease is 24.3/100,000 in those 19 years of age . Annually, more than 15,000 children and adolescents are diagnosed in the United States (US) . From 1990 to 1999, the World Health Organization (WHO) launched the Multinational Project for Childhood Diabetes (DIAMOND), which was tasked with assessing type 1 diabetes in those 14 years or younger worldwide . Finland was discovered to have the highest age-adjusted incidence at 40.9 cases per 100,000/year. The lowest age-adjusted incidence is in China and Venezuela at 0.1 cases per 100,000/year. Globally, the largest increase in incidence is in those aged 10 to 14 years . This systematic review will focus on adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes, aged 13 to 19 years who manage their diabetes with an insulin pump.Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus typically present with a history of polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, and weight loss . Initial findings include hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and ketones in the blood or urine . In 2009, the International Expert Committee deemed a haemoglobin A1C (glycosylated haemoglobin) of 6.5% or higher to be the standard for diagnosis . The American Diabetes Association (ADA) as well as the International Diabetes Federation and the European Association Study of Diabetes (EASD) accept this measure as the diagnostic tool for diabetes. Haemoglobin A1C is the most commonly used measurement for patients with type 1 diabetes . It refers to the measurement of the amount of glucose bound to haemoglobin. It is an average of blood glucose levels for the last 120 days, which is consistent with the average life span of a red blood cell (RBC).Compensation for the lack of insulin-secreting βeta-cells is accomplished through administration of insulin. For adolescents, insulin dosing is based on pubescent status, age, weight, activity level, and amount of carbohydrates consumed . Insulin administration, carbohydrate counting, and correction of hyperglycemia are necessary for maintaining glycemic control. Insulin can be administered through multiple daily injections (MDI) of rapid, intermediate and long-acting insulin .Another form of insulin delivery is the Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII), also known as an insulin pump, which is designed to meet physiological requirements through programmable basal rates and bolus doses . CSII's utilise rapid-acting insulin and establish a basal rate, which replaces the need for long-acting insulin. Bolus dosing is accomplished through adjusting the pump and is utilised to account for nutritional intake as well as hyperglycemia correction. Adjustments are also made for physical activity and exercise, as this can affect glucose levels . All patients considered in this systematic review will be utilising insulin pumps.In 2006, the United States had more than 35,000 patients, under the age of 21 years, receiving insulin therapy through an insulin pump . In Europe, the percentage of people with type 1 diabetes utilising a CSII is lower, potentially due to variation in health care coverage . There are various forms of insulin pumps, all with similar capabilities including a dose calculator for high blood glucose correction and carbohydrate ratios, programming software, and several other features . Software and programming is specific to each manufacturer. Basal rate abilities vary in each model from 0.05 units/hour to 30 units/hour . Information from the pump can be uploaded to online registries allowing providers to review trends and usage. It is imperative the information is reviewed concurrently with glucose monitoring results in order to ensure appropriate dosing and treatment .The intervention considered in this systematic review is the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in conjunction with a CSII. CGM utilises a sensor placed in the interstitial subcutaneous tissue, which then measures glucose levels. This is accomplished with ""electrochemical sensors that use glucose oxidase and measure an electric current generated when glucose reacts with oxygen. The sensors are coated with a specialised membrane to make them biocompatible"" . The CGM has programmable high and low levels to alert the user when the limit is being reached. Information regarding continuous glucose levels can then be downloaded and reviewed. Based on the report, providers, patients, and caregivers may assess trends and consider changing basal rates or bolus doses .CGM sensors currently do not offer a closed-loop solution. The user must enter insulin dosing information into the pump, taking into account the present glucose level and duration of action of the insulin. Currently, CGMs are regarded as a supplemental method for assessing the effectiveness of glucose control. Existing studies are underway to improve accuracy and communication between the sensor and insulin pump with the goal to develop an artificial pancreas . Currently, CGM sensors must be calibrated with a glucometer, as specified by the manufacturer .The comparison for this review is the standard of care, self-glucose monitoring (SGM), in patients with insulin pumps . SGM is accomplished with a glucometer and blood sample typically obtained from a finger prick. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) demonstrated frequency of monitoring improves glycemic control and decreases the risk of comorbidity . Data from this significant study continues to contribute to current diabetes management. According to the ADA, children and adolescents should monitor their blood glucose at least three or more times per day. Blood glucose data is utilised to calculate appropriate insulin doses. Similar to the CGM, information from the glucometers can be downloaded for assessment of results and trends. However, the result is dependent on the action of the patient to obtain the sample and only represents a specific moment in time whereas the CGM sensor continuously tracks the blood glucose level. Depending on the model, CGM can provide glucose levels every one to ten minutes. The sensor may last for up to 72 hours and results are available in real time .This systematic review will address two metabolic outcomes: a decrease in the number of hypoglycemic episodes and a haemoglobin A1C level <7.5%. These outcomes were chosen due to their significance as indicators in the management of type 1 diabetes. Glucose levels should be between 90 mg/dL and 130 mg/dL (5.0mmol/l and 7.2mmol/l) before meals and between 90 mg/dL and 150 mg/dL at night (5.0mmmol/l and 8.3mmol/l) . Optimal care of an adolescent with type 1 diabetes mellitus is to safely maintain glycemic control and avoid hypoglycemia.Haemoglobin A1C is an indicator of how well the disease is being managed and should be evaluated every three months. McCulloch recommends the haemoglobin A1C level should be compared to approximately 50 recent blood glucose readings to ensure the accuracy of patient SGM . The reliability and validity of this test is based on the evidence discovered by the DCCT demonstrating those with lower haemoglobin A1C levels have fewer complications . The target A1C for adolescents, aged 13 to 19 years of age, is <7.5% . This is consistent with the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) and diabetes management guidelines of the Australasian Paediatric Endocrine Group for the Department of Health and Ageing .An initial search for a systematic review regarding insulin pumps in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus and concurrent use of CGM was conducted in the Joanna Briggs Institute Library of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PubMed. No systematic reviews were found.

Insulin pumps in pregnancy: using technology to achieve normoglycemia in women with diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22105415/),"
Poorly controlled diabetes before conception and during pregnancy among women with pre-existing diabetes can cause major birth defects and spontaneous abortions, as wells as abnormal fetal growth and development including an offspring who is small or large for gestational age, or predisposed to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in his/her lifetime. Conversely, for a woman with pre-existing diabetes, optimizing blood glucose levels before and during early pregnancy can reduce these risks dramatically. As insulin pump technology has evolved, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion has become a safe and reliable method for treating diabetes during pregnancy. Although pump therapy is often preferred by patients and some experts, insulin pumps have not yet been shown to be superior to multiple daily injections of insulin during pregnancy. In this review of the literature we focus on the use of insulin pumps in the management of diabetes in pregnancy.

Diabetes technology and treatments in the paediatric age group.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21323816/),"
Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is one of the most common chronic childhood diseases and its incidence has doubled during the last decade. The goals of intensive management of diabetes were established in 1993 by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (1). Children with T1D and their caregivers continue to face the challenge to maintain blood glucose levels in the near-normal range. It is important to prevent sustained hyperglycaemia which is associated with long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications and to avoid recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia or hyperglycaemia, especially in young children, which may have adverse effects on cognitive function and impede efforts to achieve the recommended glycaemic targets. Advances in the use of technology that may help maintain the metabolic control goals for young people with T1D were centred on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (2-4), continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) (5-7), and combining both technologies into a closed-loop system (8-10). The dilemma in paediatrics of patient selection for insulin pump therapy was found to be most successful in those with more frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and younger age prior to pump initiation (2). Similarly, those who used a dual-wave bolus probably paid closer attention to their management and had lower HbA1c levels (3). The advantage of using a pre-meal bolus to improve postprandial glucose levels was shown to offer another potential method to improve glycaemic control (4). SMBG is an important component of therapy in patients with diabetes, especially in the paediatric age group. Standard use of glucose meters for SMBG provides only intermittent single blood glucose levels, without giving the 'whole picture' of glucose variability during the 24 h, and especially during the night, when blood glucose levels are seldom measured. Therefore, the use of a device such as real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) that provides continuous glucose measurements can help patients optimise glycaemic control. These devices may have the potential to increase the proportion of patients who are able to maintain target HbA1c values, to decrease glucose excursions and to decrease the risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Previous studies in paediatric T1D patients (11,12) have demonstrated that the frequency of CGM use was significantly associated with the effect of lowering HbA1c levels. The important STAR 3 study of 485 patients (156 children) with T1D showed the benefit of sensor-augmented pump therapy over remaining on multiple daily injections (MDI) (10). The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Continuous Glucose Monitoring (JDRF-CGM) studies were initially described in the 2009 Yearbook (13). Further reports of youths and adults in this study found that those with initial low HbA1c levels (< 7%) show a significant benefit from the use of CGM (5). Prolonged nocturnal hypoglycaemia was shown to continue to be a common occurrence in the entire cohort using CGM (7). Thus, there is an obvious need for closing the loop. Many patients with diabetes and especially parents of diabetic children dream about the invention of an 'artificial pancreas'. CSII and RT-CGM can be combined to form closed-loop systems. Insulin is then delivered according to RT-CGM data, as directed by a control algorithm, rather than at pre-programmed rates. Few closed-loop prototypes have been developed with advanced control algorithms, such as those that are based on model predictive control (14). The group at Cambridge studied 19 young people in closed-loop systems and was able to demonstrate that exercise and diet variations could be aptly managed (9). It is expected that closed-loop studies in young people will continue to multiply in future years. T1D is characterised by immune-mediated pancreatic β-cell destruction. Thus, a major goal in the treatment of T1D in youth will be in the area of prevention. The identification of increased levels of inflammatory markers in the SEARCH study of young people with T1D may provide an important clue (15). Most of the studies countered the diabetes process by immunomodulation and/or enhancement of β-cell proliferation and regeneration (16). An initial pilot trial of a tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α) binding agent, Entanercept, showed benefit in preserving C-peptide production in 18 young people with newly diagnosed T1D. HbA1c levels were also lower in the treatment group (5.9% ± 0.5% vs. 6.98% ± 1.2%; p < 0.05) (17). Similarly, β-cell function was shown to be preserved in children receiving the lower of two doses of ingested human recombinant interferon-α (hrINF-α) in comparison with subjects who received placebo (18). A future larger trial of both of these agents will be of interest. In this review of the literature we have tried to select recent publications that offer some insight into these issues in paediatric patients with T1D.

Insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21323808/),"
The last year has seen a continued uptake of insulin pump therapy in most countries. The USA is still a leader in pump use, with probably some 40% of type 1 diabetic patients on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), but the large variation in usage within Europe remains, with relatively high use (> 15%) in, for example, Norway, Austria, Germany and Sweden and low use (< 5%) in Spain, the UK, Finland and Portugal. There is much speculation on the factors responsible for this variation, and the possibilities include physician attitudes to CSII and knowledge about its benefits and indications for its use (and inappropriate beliefs about dangers), the availability of reimbursement from insurance companies or funding from national health services, the availability of sufficient diabetes nurse educators and dietitians trained in pump procedures, and clear referral pathways for the pump candidate from general practitioner or general hospital to specialist pump centre. There are now several comprehensive national guidelines on CSII use (see ATTD Yearbook 2009) but more work needs to be done in unifying uptake and ensuring all those who can benefit do so. Technology developments recently include increasing use of pumps with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) connectivity (see elsewhere in this volume) and the emergence of numerous manufacturers developing so-called 'patch pumps', often for the type 2 diabetes market. Interestingly, the evidence base for CSII in this group is not well established, and for this reason the selected papers on CSII in this section include several in this area. The use of CSII in diabetic pregnancy is a long-established practice, in spite of the lack of evidence that it is superior to multiple daily injections (MDI), and few randomised controlled trials have been done in recent years. Several papers in this field this year continue the debate about the usefulness of CSII in diabetic pregnancy and are reviewed here. It is pleasing to see more research on the psychosocial aspects of CSII during the year, both from the point of view of how psychological beliefs influence outcomes on CSII (is there a type of patient who does particularly well or poorly on CSII?) and how CSII affects psychological factors like mood, behaviour and quality of life. Quality of life is a difficult topic with doubts that the instruments always capture the aspects of quality of life important to the patient, and there have been conflicting results over the years about whether CSII alters quality of life. Patients in the clinic usually say that it does, and more evidence for quality of life improvement in pump therapy is reviewed here.

Availability of insulin pump therapy in clinical practice.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22050599/),"
To examine the availability of insulin pump therapy in patients with Type 1 diabetes.
Patients using insulin pumps among a cohort of 7224 patients with Type 1 diabetes were studied.
In logistic regression, used to evaluate variables not changing over time among the total cohort, use of insulin pumps varied by outpatient clinic (P<0.001) and sex (P<0.001). Cox regression analysis in 5854 patients with detailed patient data prior to use of an insulin pump showed higher HbA(1c) (P<0.0001), lower creatinine (P=0.002), high and low insulin doses (P<0.0001), younger age (P<0.0001) and female sex (P<0.0001) to be associated with use of an insulin pump. Women were 1.5-fold more likely to start using an insulin pump (hazard ratio 1.52, 95% confidence interval 1.29-1.79) and patients in the 20- to 30-years age range were more than twice as likely to begin use of an insulin pump than patients aged 40-50 years (hazard ratio 8.63, 95% confidence interval 5.91-12.59 and hazard ratio 3.98, 95% confidence interval 2.80-5.64, respectively). A 10-μmol/l higher level of creatinine was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.56 (95% confidence interval 0.39-0.81) of starting use of an insulin pump.
At 10 hospital outpatient clinics in Sweden, use of insulin pumps therapy varied by clinic. A higher proportion of women began using insulin pumps. Younger patients and patients with fewer complications were also more likely to start using an insulin pump. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in other geographical regions and to understand whether the availability of insulin pumps today is optimized.

Treatment of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents using modern insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21864743/),"
In the last decades, we are experiencing an increasing use of insulin pumps for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents. The most frequent reasons for switching from insulin injection schemes to pump therapy are frequent and/or severe hypoglycaemia, dawn phenomenon, poor glycaemic control, wish for more flexibility in daily life, and needle phobia. In toddlers and preschoolers, pumps are frequently introduced from the onset of type 1 diabetes. Pumps offer the possibility of adjusting basal insulin rates individually on an age-depended manner as well as of optimizing meal-related insulin requirements according to the meal composition by using three different kinds of boluses. Structured and intensive education of patients and their families on basics and specific requirements of insulin pump therapy is essential in order to get them familiar with the devices and their features. There is increasing evidence both from multicentre cross-sectional studies as well as from meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials in paediatric populations showing that patients with pump therapy can achieve a more favourable metabolic control accompanied with less hypoglycaemic events than those with multiple daily injections.

Insulin pump therapy in adults.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21864741/),"
Restoration of the physiological insulin secretion is a current medical challenge and a dream for patients with Diabetes Mellitus. Continuous insulin therapy using pumps was the first step to the development of artificial pancreas. The aim of diabetes treatment is to achieve strict glycemic control in order to avoid the development of long-term diabetic complications while reducing the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump, offers both a better blood glucose stability as compared to multiple daily injections and a broader flexibility in life mode, and reduces the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. The advantages of the insulin pump (consistency of basal delivery, adjustable basal rates, and low insulin depots allowing the reduction of glycemic variability) have contributed to its reported superiority compared with multiple daily injections (MDI). However, experience with CSII indicates that candidates for insulin pump therapy must be carefully selected and strongly motivated to improve their glucose control. Finally, the use of CSII in patients with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 now appears to be a good alternative to the ineffective MDI regimens observed in some of these patients.

Insulin pump therapy with automated insulin suspension in response to hypoglycemia: reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia in those at greatest risk.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21868778/),"
To evaluate a sensor-augmented insulin pump with a low glucose suspend (LGS) feature that automatically suspends basal insulin delivery for up to 2 h in response to sensor-detected hypoglycemia.
The LGS feature of the Paradigm Veo insulin pump (Medtronic, Inc., Northridge, CA) was tested for 3 weeks in 31 adults with type 1 diabetes.
There were 166 episodes of LGS: 66% of daytime LGS episodes were terminated within 10 min, and 20 episodes lasted the maximum 2 h. LGS use was associated with reduced nocturnal duration â‰¤2.2 mmol/L in those in the highest quartile of nocturnal hypoglycemia at baseline (median 46.2 vs. 1.8 min/day, P = 0.02 [LGS-OFF vs. LGS-ON]). Median sensor glucose was 3.9 mmol/L after 2-h LGS and 8.2 mmol/L at 2 h after basal restart.
Use of an insulin pump with LGS was associated with reduced nocturnal hypoglycemia in those at greatest risk and was well accepted by patients.

Behaviour and metabolic control in children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus on insulin pump therapy: 2-year follow-up.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21843306/),"
This study investigated whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is associated with sustained improvement in behaviour and metabolic control.
Children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (n = 27, 8-18 years old) who had been assessed previously prior to commencing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, and 6-8 weeks later, were re-evaluated 2 years after commencing insulin pump therapy. Behaviour was reassessed using the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-2nd edition (BASC-2) and current HbA(1c) levels were recorded.
Two years after commencing continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, parent-reported internalizing and externalizing symptoms were significantly lower than pre-insulin pump therapy commencement levels. Self reports of internalizing and externalizing problems did not differ significantly across the three assessment points. There was no significant difference between pre-insulin pump therapy HbA(1c) and HbA(1c) after 2 years on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, despite an initial improvement 6-8 weeks after commencing the therapy.
Children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus showed sustained improvements in parent-reported behaviour, but not in self reports of behaviour or in metabolic control 2 years after commencement of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

Insulin pump therapy in patients with diabetes undergoing surgery.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21803711/),"
To assess perioperative management of patients with diabetes mellitus who were being treated with insulin pump therapy.
We reviewed records for documentation of insulin pump status and glucose monitoring during preoperative, intraoperative, and postanesthesia care unit (PACU) phases of surgery.
Thirty-five patients (21 men) with insulin pumps underwent surgical procedures between January 1, 2006, and December 31, 2010. Mean age was 56 years, mean diabetes duration was 31 years, and mean duration of insulin pump therapy was 7 years. All patients were white, and 29 had type 1 diabetes mellitus. Of the 50 surgical procedures performed during the study period, 16 were orthopedic, 9 were general surgical, 7 were urologic, and 7 were kidney transplant operations; the remaining 11 procedures were in other surgical specialties. The mean (± standard deviation) time in the preoperative area was 118 ± 75 minutes, mean intraoperative time was 177 ± 102 minutes, and mean PACU time was 170 ± 78 minutes. Of the 50 procedures, status of pump use was documented in 32 cases in the preoperative area, 14 cases intraoperatively, and 30 cases in the PACU. Glucose values were recorded in 47 cases preoperatively, 30 cases intraoperatively, and 48 cases in the PACU.
Results showed inconsistent documentation of pump use and glucose monitoring throughout the perioperative period, even for patients with prolonged anesthesia and recovery times. It was often unclear whether the pump was in place and operational during the intraoperative period. Guidelines should be developed for management of insulin pump-treated patients who are to undergo surgery.

New-generation diabetes management: glucose sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21728731/),"
Diabetes is one of the most common chronic disorders with an increasing incidence worldwide. Technologic advances in the field of diabetes have provided new tools for clinicians to manage this challenging disease. For example, the development of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion systems have allowed for refinement in the delivery of insulin, while continuous glucose monitors provide patients and clinicians with a better understanding of the minute to minute glucose variability, leading to the titration of insulin delivery based on this variability when applicable. Merging of these devices has resulted in sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy, which became a major building block upon which the artificial pancreas (closed-loop systems) can be developed. This article summarizes the evolution of sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy until present day and its future applications in new-generation diabetes management.

Economic benefits of improved insulin stability in insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21667627/),"
Insulin pump users discard unused medication and infusion sets according to labeling and manufacturer's instructions. The stability labeling for insulin aspart (rDNA origin] (Novolog) was increased from two days to six. The associated savings was modeled from the perspective of a hypothetical one-million member health plan and the total United States population.
The discarded insulin volume and the number of infusion sets used under a two-day stability scenario versus six were modeled.
A mix of insulin pumps of various reservoir capacities with a range of daily insulin dosages was used. Average daily insulin dose was 65 units ranging from 10 to 150 units. Costs of discarded insulin aspart [rDNA origin] were calculated using WAC (Average Wholesale Price minus 16.67%). The cost of pump supplies was computed for the two-day scenario assuming a complete infusion set change, including reservoirs, every two days. Under the six-day scenario complete infusion sets were discarded every six days while cannulas at the insertion site were changed midway between complete changes. AWP of least expensive supplies was used to compute their costs.
For the hypothetical health plan (1,182 pump users) the annual reduction in discarded insulin volume between scenarios was 19.8 million units. The corresponding cost reduction for the plan due to drug and supply savings was $3.4 million. From the U.S. population perspective, savings of over $1 billion were estimated.
Using insulin that is stable for six days in pump reservoirs can yield substantial savings to health plans and other payers, including patients.

A bridge to insulin pump therapy: twice-daily regimen with NPH and detemir insulins during initial treatment of youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21550949/),"
To describe clinical outcomes in youth with new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with a modified, twice-daily regimen of a mixture of NPH insulin and rapid-acting insulin analogue at breakfast and separate injections of rapid-acting insulin analogue and insulin detemir at dinner.
Our clinic database was used to describe changes in insulin doses, hemoglobin A1c (A1C) levels, and frequency of severe hypoglycemia during the first year of therapy in young patients with T1DM diagnosed between September 2006 and April 2009. Data are presented as median values (25%, 75%).
Overall, 108 patients (62 girls; mean age, 10.0 Â± 0.4 years) were eligible for inclusion. Total daily insulin doses at 3, 6, and 12 months were 0.6 (0.4, 0.8), 0.7 (0.4, 0.9), and 0.8 (0.6, 0.9) U/kg, respectively. A1C levels were 9.8% (8.5%, 10.8%) at 2 weeks (baseline). Of the 108 patients, 19 had switched to insulin pump therapy by 3 months and 49 had switched by 12 months after initial diagnosis of T1DM. The 49 pump-treated patients had an A1C of 6.9% (6.6%, 7.3%), whereas the 59 injection-treated patients had an A1C of 7.2% (6.7%, 7.7%) by 12 months. There were only 6 severe hypoglycemic events in 5 patients; none occurred during the first 3 months, none occurred during the night, and all occurred in patients receiving insulin injection treatment.
A twice-daily insulin regimen that uses insulin detemir for overnight basal replacement and morning NPH insulin to avoid lunch and afternoon snack doses is an effective initial treatment for young patients with new-onset T1DM that can provide a smooth transition to intensive basal/bolus insulin pump therapy.

[Hypoglycemia in patients treated with an external insulin pump].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21400952/),"
Hypoglycemia is a potentially serious complication of insulin therapy. Some insulin-dependent diabetic patients can benefit from continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (an ""insulin pump""), which in most case improves glycemia control and decreases the occurrence of hypoglycemic episodes. However, such events may occur, particularly during initial treatment phases or pregnancy. Severe hypoglycemia is mainly managed by stopping the insulin pump and insuring an adequate carbohydrate intake. Patients with insulin pumps and their entourage should receive specific instruction in the adjustment of pump flow in the presence of dysglycemia-inducing circumstances (illness, physical exertion), as well as in anticipation of high-risk situations, such as motor-vehicle driving.

Sensor-augmented pump therapy lowers HbA(1c) in suboptimally controlled Type 1 diabetes; a randomized controlled trial.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21294770/),"
To investigate the efficacy of sensor-augmented pump therapy vs. multiple daily injection therapy in patients with suboptimally controlled Type 1 diabetes.
In this investigator-initiated multi-centre trial (the Eurythmics Trial) in eight outpatient centres in Europe, we randomized 83 patients with Type 1 diabetes (40 women) currently treated with multiple daily injections, age 18-65 years and HbA(1c) ≥ 8.2% (≥ 66 mmol/mol) to 26 weeks of treatment with either a sensor-augmented insulin pump (n = 44) (Paradigm(®) REAL-Time) or continued with multiple daily injections (n = 39). Change in HbA(1c) between baseline and 26 weeks, sensor-derived endpoints and patient-reported outcomes were assessed.
The trial was completed by 43/44 (98%) patients in the sensor-augmented insulin pump group and 35/39 (90%) patients in the multiple daily injections group. Mean HbA(1c) at baseline and at 26 weeks changed from 8.46% (SD 0.95) (69 mmol/mol) to 7.23% (SD 0.65) (56 mmol/mol) in the sensor-augmented insulin pump group and from 8.59% (SD 0.82) (70 mmol/mol) to 8.46% (SD 1.04) (69 mmol/mol) in the multiple daily injections group. Mean difference in change in HbA(1c) after 26 weeks was -1.21% (95% confidence interval -1.52 to -0.90, P < 0.001) in favour of the sensor-augmented insulin pump group. This was achieved without an increase in percentage of time spent in hypoglycaemia: between-group difference 0.0% (95% confidence interval -1.6 to 1.7, P = 0.96). There were four episodes of severe hypoglycaemia in the sensor-augmented insulin pump group and one episode in the multiple daily injections group (P = 0.21). Problem Areas in Diabetes and Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire scores improved in the sensor-augmented insulin pump group.
Sensor augmented pump therapy effectively lowers HbA(1c) in patients with Type 1 diabetes suboptimally controlled with multiple daily injections.

Insulin pumps and real-time continuous glucose monitoring devices have recently been combined into the sensor-augmented pump (SAP) system. The objective of this study was the evaluation of the clinical use of SAP in a large series of children with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy.
A questionnaire was administered in all pediatric diabetologic centers in Italy; data were analyzed only regarding patients 18 years old or younger and using SAP for 6 months or more.
Among all patients using an insulin pump, 129 (13.5 ± 3.8 years old, with a disease duration of 6.3 ± 3.4 years) have been using SAP for 1.4 ± 0.7 years. Four hundred ninety-three patients (12.9 ± 3.4 years old, with a disease duration of 6.2 ± 3.3 years) using conventional insulin pump therapy for 1.7 ± 0.5 years have been evaluated as the control group. After 0.5-3 years of using SAP or conventional insulin pump therapy, glycosylated hemoglobin significantly improved (8.0 ± 1.5% vs. 7.4 ± 0.8% [P = 0.002] and 8.0 ± 1.6% vs. 7.7 ± 1.1% [P = 0.006], respectively); the improvement was higher with SAP (P = 0.005). Insulin requirement showed a significant decrease only in SAP patients (0.88 ± 0.25 vs. 0.7 ± 0.23 U/kg/day, P = 0.003). Body mass index did not change during the observation period. No diabetic ketoacidosis episodes were observed during the follow-up, and severe hypoglycemia significantly decreased in SAP patients (P = 0.04).
The increased availability of continuous glucose sensors is likely to have a significant impact on pediatric diabetes therapy and education in the near future. In daily settings, patients using SAP can achieve a better control than patients using conventional insulin pump.

Fear of hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes managed by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: is it associated with poor glycemic control?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21284474/),"
We surveyed the extent of fear of hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and tested the hypothesis that suboptimal glycemic control during CSII is related to fear of hypoglycemia.
We audited nonpregnant type 1 diabetes patients attending an Insulin Pump Clinic with at least 6 months' duration of CSII. In 104 eligible subjects, fear of hypoglycemia was assessed by questionnaire; 75 responded.
The median duration of CSII was 5 years (range, 1-29 years). Poor glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥ 8.5%; mean ± SD, 9.1 ± 1.0%) was present in 27%, and this group had more men than a good-control group with HbA1c < 7.0% (43% vs. 11%). Substantial fear of hypoglycemia (score > 50%) occurred in 27% of subjects, but fear of hypoglycemia was not correlated with HbA1c. The only significant correlates of fear of hypoglycemia were accumulated episodes of severe hypoglycemia (r = 0.48, P < 0.001) and rate of hypoglycemia on CSII (r = 0.48, P < 0.001). The HbA1c on CSII was correlated with multiple daily injection (MDI) HbA1c (r = 0.66, P < 0.001) and the change in HbA1c (r = 0.63, P < 0.001).
Fear of hypoglycemia is not correlated with, and is unlikely to be a major determinant of, HbA1c on CSII. Other factors (such as HbA1c on MDI and adherence to insulin pump procedures) are likely to be more important. Nevertheless, substantial fear of hypoglycemia is present in many CSII-treated people and may adversely affect quality of life and psychological well-being.

To study the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three different modes of insulin infusion delivered by means of an insulin pump: subcutaneous bolus insulin injection once an hour, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous intravenous insulin infusion.
In random order, ten patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus received insulin aspart with subcutaneous bolus insulin injection, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous intravenous insulin infusion. The insulin aspart doses were individualized.
  A non-random, sinus-like variation of serum insulin aspart over time was found with subcutaneous bolus insulin injection compared with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous intravenous insulin infusion (P<0.0001). Random variation of serum insulin aspart over time was significantly higher with continuous intravenous insulin infusion compared with subcutaneous bolus insulin injection (P=0.023) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (P=0.013). Mean serum insulin aspart did not differ significantly between subcutaneous bolus insulin injection, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous intravenous insulin infusion (P=0.17). Thus, absolute bioavailability was near 100% for both subcutaneous bolus insulin injection and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Statistically significant differences were seen in mean plasma glucose and mean glucose infusion rate, with the highest mean plasma glucose and the lowest mean glucose infusion rate with continuous intravenous insulin infusion, suggesting a slightly lower bioefficacy of continuous intravenous insulin infusion compared with subcutaneous bolus insulin injection and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.
Small but statistically significant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between subcutaneous bolus insulin injection, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and continuous intravenous insulin infusion were observed. However, no major clinically relevant differences were found, suggesting that, for a basal subcutaneous insulin aspart pump therapy, relatively infrequent pump stroke frequency may suffice.

[Glucokinase gene mutation as a causative factor of permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22525692/),"
The most frequent type of diabetes in childhood is type 1 diabetes. Thanks to the development of genetic testing, the rare monogenic forms of that disease have been defined. One of them is neonatal diabetes identified within the first 6 months of life and often associated with the mutation in KCNJ11, ABCC8 or insulin gene. A less frequent mutation in the glucokinase gene can cause both permanent neonatal diabetes as well as mild diabetes MODY 2.
A 33-day-old boy admitted to hospital because of hyperglycemia from the first day of life. Treatment with intravenous infusion of insulin since 5 days of life. A child born out of the first pregnancy in the 37th week of gestation, with hypotrophy symptoms. The pregnancy had been complicated by gestational diabetes. Birth weight 2030 g. Insulin and c-peptide level significantly below normal. Immunologic markers of type 1 diabetes were negative. A continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using a personal insulin pump was begun in the 60th day of life. Irregularities in the economy of carbohydrates were found in the parents. A double mutation in the glucokinase gene in genetic testing explained the cause of neonatal diabetes. The boy had inherited from his parents two different mutations in glucokinase gene: from the mother S384L and from the father T207M. He is a complex heterozygote.
Genetic diagnosis helped determine the cause of neonatal diabetes in the child and MODY 2 diabetes in the parents. Personal insulin pump therapy is the most effective treatment in children during infancy.

However, there is still a proportion of subjects using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in whom goals for metabolic control are far from achieved or benefits of this type of insulin therapy are transient. The SWITCH (Sensing With Insulin pump Therapy to Control HbA(1c) [hemoglobin A1c]) study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, crossover study to evaluate if adding CGM to experienced pump patients with suboptimal metabolic control will provide additional insight enabling clinical and therapeutic benefit.
subjects meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized to Sensor On or Sensor Off arms for 6 months, after a 1-month run-in period. Following a 4-month washout period, the subjects crossed over to the other study arm for 6 months. The primary end point was the between arm difference in HbA(1c) levels. Among others, additional end points include time spent in different glycemic ranges, percentage of patients with HbA(1c) <7%, number of hypoglycemic events, glucose variability parameters, safety outcomes, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life.
recruitment occurred between January 2008 and February 2009. A total of 153 patients were randomized. Study completion is anticipated in July 2010.
the results will establish if adding CGM to existing, capable, insulin pump users can enable better metabolic control.

"Comparison of pharmacokinetic properties, physicochemical stability, and pump compatibility of 3 rapid-acting insulin analogues-aspart, lispro, and glulisine.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21134878/),"
To compare how the rapid-acting insulin analogues (RAIAs) aspart, lispro, and glulisine perform in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy regarding (1) pharmacokinetic properties, (2) chemical and physical stability, and (3) pump compatibility.
PubMed was searched for articles pertaining to the use of RAIAs in CSII, without a restriction on the time period.
These RAIAs have pharmacokinetic profiles that more closely mimic endogenous insulin in comparison with regular human insulin and tend to produce less hypoglycemia. Among these RAIAs, the rates of absorption and clinical efficacy in terms of glycemic control were similar. Although glulisine showed a faster onset of action in some studies with aspart and lispro, this advantage lasted only for a maximum of 1 hour, after which results were similar for glulisine and aspart or lispro. Each RAIA is created by making minor amino acid substitutions to the regular human insulin molecule and adding a stabilizer to help prevent fibrillation. A series of chemical and covalent changes affecting the primary structure of an insulin preparation, however, may cause decomposition during storage, handling, and use, diminishing the potency of the insulin molecule while contained in an insulin pump. Precipitation, fibrillation, and occlusion may ensue, undermining compatibility for CSII pump use. Aspart has demonstrated the greatest chemical and physical stability in the insulin pump, with the lowest rates of overall occlusion in comparison with lispro and glulisine (aspart 9.2%, lispro 15.7%, and glulisine 40.9%; P<.01).
Aspart is the most compatible of the 3 RAIAs for pump use.

Efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 2 diabetes mellitus: a survey on a cohort of 102 patients with prolonged follow-up.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21128839/),"
We evaluated the long-term efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for treating type 2 diabetes patients uncontrolled by multiple daily injections.
All 102 type 2 diabetes patients who began insulin pump therapy at Caen University Hospital (Caen, France) between January 1998 and August 2008 were included in a retrospective observational study. Ninety-three percent of the patients were previously treated by insulin with a mean duration of 5.6 years.
The median duration of follow-up with CSII was 24 months. A1c glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) improved from baseline (9.3 ± 1.8%) to the 1-year evaluation (7.8 ± 1.4%) (P < 0.001). The magnitude of HbA1c improvement was highly dependent on (1) pretreatment HbA1c level, (2) degree of patient's autonomy, and (3) previous antidiabetes treatment. HbA1c decreased by 0.9 ± 1.6% (P = 0.002) in the group previously treated by a basal-bolus regimen. HbA1c decrease was maintained at follow-up until 6 years (P < 0.05). Mean body weight gain was 3.9 ± 8.6 kg at 1 year (P < 0.001) and remained stable at follow-up. No significant change in insulin requirement was observed.
The use of CSII in patients with type 2 diabetes is safe and effective for improving glycemic control, particularly in those patients with baseline HbA1c above 8%. Such beneficial effect of CSII may persist until 6-year follow-up, suggesting the durability of CSII efficacy in our study population.

Retrospective analysis and patient satisfaction assessment of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21079529/),"
To evaluate and assess glycemic control, total daily insulin requirements, weight, and patient satisfaction after changing from multiple daily injections (MDI) to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes.
This was a retrospective cross-sectional cohort analysis of an electronic medical records database from a private physician's clinic. Patients over 18 years of age who had type 2 diabetes and who utilized CSII for at least six months were analyzed. Variables of interest included glycosylated hemoglobin, total daily insulin requirements, and weight at the time of conversion from MDI to CSII. Patients were also asked to complete a satisfaction survey comparing MDI to CSII.
Thirty patients who met the inclusion criteria were identified. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased from 9.25% ± 2.20 to 7.94% ± 1.65 (P < 0.001) at six months, total daily insulin dose decreased from 1.33 ± 0.66 u/kg/day to 1.08 ± 0.70 u/kg/day (P < 0.001) at six months, and weight increased from 106.66 ± 19.17 kg to 109.75 ± 18.01 kg (P < 0.001). After twelve months, HbA1c did not significantly change and weight returned to baseline; however, total daily insulin dose significantly decreased. 95% of patients preferred CSII therapy to previous injection regimen for various reasons.
Insulin pump therapy provided better glycemic control and reduced the total amount of insulin utilized. Patients who utilized CSII thought that the treatment was more convenient, less burdensome, and provided better control of fluctuations in blood glucose. CSII was preferred by patients over multiple daily injections.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external insulin pump for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20888280/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump is widely used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, but has been less evaluated in type 2 diabetes. This review analyzes the open-label as well as randomized controlled studies performed in type 2 diabetic patients. The efficacy of CSII is compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) in terms of glycaemic control, weight variation, insulin requirements, treatment satisfaction and hypoglycaemic events. CSII may be offered as an alternative treatment to type 2 diabetic patients with poor glycaemic control despite high-dose insulin requirements administered through MDI.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in Type 1 diabetes: patient experiences of 'living with a machine'.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20873363/),"
The aims of this study were to provide in-depth insight into the changes that may be experienced by patients embarking on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and to answer the research question, what is it like to live with an insulin pump?
An in-depth, qualitative, multiple interview study of individuals with Type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in a secondary care setting in the south of England. Four patients (two male, two female)across the age range and with varied experience of pump use, were recruited from a specialist diabetes centre.
Switching from multiple injection therapy to insulin pump therapy presents challenges in the short term.Over a longer period, use of this technology is associated with a significant improvement in quality of life for the users and also a change in the relationship between the patient and their specialist healthcare provider.
Insulin pump therapy has additional qualitative benefits beyond improvements in glycaemic control and reducing the risk of hypoglycaemia for people with Type 1 diabetes.

Factors affecting improved glycaemic control in youth using insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20854386/),"
The purpose of this study was to evaluate factors associated with insulin pump therapy resulting in lower HbA(1c) levels in young people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Insulin pumps were downloaded from 150 youth (81 male), ages 5-20 years. Consecutive insulin pump downloads, 3 months apart, were available for 85 (43 male) of the 150 youth and changes in pump use were correlated with changes (≥0.5%, ≥ 6 mmol/mol) in HbA(1c) levels.
  Using cross-sectional data, lower HbA(1c) values correlated with use of more frequent daily insulin boluses (r=-0.46, P<0.0001) and more frequent blood glucose checks/day (r=-0.35, P<0.0001). Young people with HbA(1c) levels <7.5% (58 mmol/mol) vs. values of 7.5-9.0% (58-75 mmol/mol) or ≥ 9.0% (75 mmol/mol) tested blood glucose more frequently/day (P<0.0001), bolused more frequently/day (P<0.0001), reported more grams of carbohydrates eaten/day (P<0.05) and had a higher per cent bolus insulin/day (P<0.05) compared with the ≥9.0% of youth. Using longitudinal data, 48 of 85 patients had a change in HbA(1c) level of ≥0.5% (6 mmol/mol) between downloads (24 improved). Increased bolus insulin (OR=1.15, P=0.03) and time of temporary basal rate use (OR=1.017, P=0.01) predicted ≥0.5% (6 mmol/mol) decrease in HbA(1c) in logistic regression.
This study emphasizes the importance of blood glucose testing, of bolus insulin administration and of an increase in the time of temporary basal rate use in relation to improving glycaemic control.

"Lower rate of initial failures and reduced occurrence of adverse events with a new catheter model for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: prospective, two-period, observational, multicenter study.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20809682/),"
No recent clinical data on the incidence of catheter-related adverse events under insulin pump therapy have been reported.
This was a prospective, two-period, observational, multicenter study in 45 diabetes outpatients (mean continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII] use, 6 years; mean hemoglobin A1c, 7.7%, at baseline). During the initial 1-month period (P1), the patients used their current catheter model, including a soft cannula in 98% of cases. They moved then to the new Accu-Chek FlexLink catheter model (Disetronic Medical Systems AG, Burgdorf, Switzerland) for a 3-month period. The primary end point, including insertion failures and unexplained hyperglycemia within the first 6h after catheter placement, was assessed from logbook records during P1 and the last month of the second period (P2). Secondary end points were catheter replacements for unexplained hyperglycemia and/or events at risk for immediate insulin delivery failure after the first 6h.
Forty-five initial infusion failures occurred in 14 patients among 507 catheter insertions (8.9% of cases) during P1, whereas 15 similar events were seen in nine patients during P2 among 488 catheter insertions (3.1% of cases) (P<0.001). Catheters were replaced for later infusion troubles in 8% of cases during both P1 and P2. The overall rate of late cumulative events was, however, 113 of 507 (P1) versus 66 of 488 (P2) (P<0.001). The occurrence of pain, skin reaction, or redness at the infusion site was lower during P2.
Incidences both of initial failures and of premature catheter replacements were 8â€“9% with current CSII catheters. Significantly reduced failures after insertion and adverse events at the infusion site were observed with the new catheter model.

Use of insulin pumps in India: suggested guidelines based on experience and cultural differences.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20807118/),"
All type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) subjects and the majority of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) subjects at one time or another require insulin to sustain life. Syringes and pens are presently the most popular insulin delivery devices. Though in use for more than 3 decades, insulin pumps are now being more commonly used because of their unique ability to continuously infuse insulin, closely mimicking that of physiological secretion from a normal pancreas. Unlike insulin shots with syringes, pump infusion sites need to be changed less frequently. Scientific evidence from published studies have proven added benefit of insulin pumps in improving quality of life, normalizing sugars in recalcitrant diabetes, improving sexual function, and relieving the intractable pain of neuropathy. In the western world, pumps are commonly used with T1DM subjects, whereas in India 80% of pumpers are T2DM subjects. The success of insulin pump therapy depends on selection of the right candidate, extensive education, motivation, and implementing the sophisticated programs with skill. However, all affordable patients are not ideal candidates for pump therapy because for successful continuation of pump therapy other inclusion criteria should also be fulfilled. Among the other indications discussed are a high level of insulin resistance, brittle diabetes, chronic kidney disease on renal replacement therapy, and continuous glucose monitoring pattern strongly suggesting need for a variable basal insulin infusion rate. In International Diabetes Foundation data released in 2009, estimated diabetes prevalence for 2010 is 285 million, representing 6.4% of the world's adult population, with a prediction that by 2030 the number of people with diabetes will have increased to 438 million. Considering this massive growth in T2DM and its propensity after 10â€“15 years to lead to an insulin-deficient state, available evidence from studies is a compelling indication not to deny the benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in selected T2DM subjects. This article aims at suggesting guidelines based on clinical experience and cultural diversity for India and developing countries.

Continuous glucose monitoring-enabled insulin-pump therapy in diabetic pregnancy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20804351/),"
We describe the feasibility of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)-enabled insulin-pump therapy during pregnancy in a woman with type 1 diabetes, who was treated with CGM-enabled insulin-pump therapy in her third pregnancy. During her first pregnancy, the woman was treated with multiple daily injections and baseline HbA1c was 8.9%. Due to pre-eclampsia, the child was born preterm, and had neonatal hypoglycemia. In the planning of the second pregnancy, insulin-pump therapy was initiated, resulting in an HbA1c of 6.8% in early pregnancy. Due to pre-eclampsia, the second child was born preterm, but without neonatal morbidity. Before her third pregnancy, CGM-enabled insulin-pump therapy was introduced, and HbA1c was 6.4% in early pregnancy. The patient was satisfied with this therapy, pre-eclampsia did not occur, and the child was born at term without neonatal morbidity. CGM-enabled insulin-pump therapy appears feasible in diabetic pregnancies.

This study assessed insulin dose and dosing patterns required to optimize glycemic control with an insulin pump in patients with type 2 diabetes.
In this 16-week, open-label, multicenter, pilot study, 56 insulin pump-naive patients treated at baseline with two or more oral antidiabetes agents (OADs), basal insulin with or without OADs, or basal-bolus insulin with or without OADs discontinued all diabetes medications except metformin and initiated insulin pump therapy. Insulin doses were adjusted to optimize glycemic control with the simplest possible insulin regimen. Outcomes included total daily insulin dose, daily basal and bolus insulin doses, number of daily basal rates, hemoglobin A1C, fasting and postprandial glucose, patient-reported outcomes and rate of hypoglycemia.
After 16 weeks of pump therapy, the mean +/- SD total daily insulin dose was 95 +/- 59 U. The percentage of the total daily insulin dose used as basal and as bolus delivery was 55% and 45%, respectively. Eighty-eight percent of patients were treated with two or fewer daily basal rates. Mean A1C was lowered by 1.2 +/- 1.2% (P < 0.001), and there was no severe hypoglycemia. Mean change in body weight was +1.9 +/- 3.3 kg (P < 0.001). Overall treatment preference improved with pump therapy compared to baseline.
Insulin pump therapy using a simple dosing regimen significantly improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients experienced limited weight gain, there was no severe hypoglycemia, and overall treatment preference improved significantly.

The impact of baseline hemoglobin A1c levels prior to initiation of pump therapy on long-term metabolic control.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20597832/),"
This study was done to identify factors influencing long-term metabolic control in youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) treated with an insulin pump.
Data were obtained from retrospective chart review of 113 patients (52 males) with T1DM treated with an insulin pump for up to 7 years. Their mean +/- SD age at diagnosis of T1DM was 9.7 +/- 5.1 years, and that at pump therapy initiation was 13.8 +/- 6.1 years. Linear trends and changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels following pump insertion were evaluated according to gender, metabolic control prior to initiation of pump therapy, time from diagnosis of diabetes until pump therapy, age at initiation, and the duration of pump treatment.
Mean HbA1c levels of patients with good baseline metabolic control (HbA1c level <or=7.5%) were significantly lower during the whole follow-up period (7.2 +/- 0.9%) compared to the moderate (baseline HbA1c level 7.5% to <or=9%) and poor (baseline HbA1c level >9%) control groups (8.1 +/- 0.9% and 8.2 +/- 1.1%, respectively; P < 0.001). However, with time a significant trend for increasing HbA1c level was demonstrated in the group with good metabolic control (P value for trend = 0.004). HbA1c levels of patients with poor baseline metabolic control decreased significantly immediately after pump initiation (9.4 +/- 1.6% vs. 8.0 +/- 1.2%, P = 0.0001) and thereafter remained stable (P value for trend = 0.54). In the multivariable analyses, baseline HbA1c level <or=7.5%, duration of <or=1 year between diagnosis of diabetes and pump initiation, and younger age at pump initiation were independently associated with lower HbA1c levels during long-term follow-up.
Long-term response to pump treatment was dependent on baseline metabolic control. Early pump treatment had a significant long-term impact on metabolic control.

Evaluating older patients with diabetes for insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515314/),"
The increasing prevalence of diabetes among elderly patients underscores the importance of matching the most effective therapy for diabetes self-management with patients' cognitive and motor skills, as these diminish with advancing age. Although many geriatric patients state interest in insulin pump therapy for tight glycemic control, few studies have examined the effectiveness, safety, and feasibility of insulin pumps compared to traditional injected insulin therapy in older age groups. It is important, therefore, for physicians to recognize the indications and the age-related barriers to insulin pump therapy in geriatric patients. Indications include glucose variability, hypoglycemia, and poor glycemic control with traditional insulin regimens. Common barriers include poor vision, dexterity, and cognitive status. Successful implementation of insulin pump therapy for older patients requires an experienced diabetes management team that can assess patient needs and tailor therapy in the context of age-related disabilities.

Insulin patch pumps: their development and future in closed-loop systems.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515308/),"
Steady progress is being made toward the development of a so-called ""artificial pancreas,"" which may ultimately be a fully automated, closed-loop, glucose control system comprising a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and a controller. The controller will use individualized algorithms to direct delivery of insulin without user input. A major factor propelling artificial pancreas development is the substantial incidence of-and attendant patient, parental, and physician concerns about-hypoglycemia and extreme hyperglycemia associated with current means of insulin delivery for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). A successful fully automated artificial pancreas would likely reduce the frequency of and anxiety about hypoglycemia and marked hyperglycemia. Patch-pump systems (""patch pumps"") are likely to be used increasingly in the control of T1DM and may be incorporated into the artificial pancreas systems of tomorrow. Patch pumps are free of tubing, small, lightweight, and unobtrusive. This article describes features of patch pumps that have been approved for U.S. marketing or are under development. Included in the review is an introduction to control algorithms driving insulin delivery, particularly the two major types: proportional integrative derivative and model predictive control. The use of advanced algorithms in the clinical development of closed-loop systems is reviewed along with projected next steps in artificial pancreas development.

Designing the modern pump: engineering aspects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion software.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515305/),"
Insulin delivery systems attracted the efforts of biological, mechanical, electrical, and software engineers well before they were commercially viable. The introduction of the first commercial insulin pump in 1983 represents an enduring milestone in the history of diabetes management. Since then, pumps have become much more than motorized syringes and have assumed a central role in diabetes management by housing data on insulin delivery and glucose readings, assisting in bolus estimation, and interfacing smoothly with humans and compatible devices. Ensuring the integrity of the embedded software that controls these devices is critical to patient safety and regulatory compliance. As pumps and related devices evolve, software engineers will face challenges and opportunities in designing pumps that are safe, reliable, and feature-rich. The pumps and related systems must also satisfy end users, healthcare providers, and regulatory authorities. In particular, pumps that are combined with glucose sensors and appropriate algorithms will provide the basis for increasingly safe and precise automated insulin delivery-essential steps to developing a fully closed-loop system.

Insulin pumps and their use in pregnancy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515304/),"
The prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy has continued to increase, both as obesity drives up the rate of glucose intolerance itself and as improvements in diabetes and infertility treatments allow more women with diabetes to become and remain pregnant into the third trimester. With this increase has come a concomitant increase in the number of pregnant women using insulin to control their blood glucose in pregnancy. This review seeks to identify advantages and disadvantages of insulin pump use in pregnancy, as compared to a more traditional multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin regimen. Insulin pumps have not yet been shown to offer superior glucose control compared to MDI insulin, and thus many healthcare practitioners and health insurance companies are hesitant to adopt such a practice; however, insulin pumps often facilitate ease of usage of insulin and promote postpartum insulin use when indicated. Although only a small percentage of pregnant women with diabetes in the United States currently use insulin pumps, we believe that insulin pumps may represent a superior mode of insulin delivery for many women with diabetes in pregnancy.

Insulin pump use in Europe.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515303/),"
Although European groups have initiated innovative clinical research in the field of insulin pump therapy, insulin pump use remains currently limited in many European countries, and well behind that in the United States. The main reason is the late approval of cost coverage by most national healthcare insurance systems, which is still lacking in some countries. Partly in connection with this delay, the number of trained physicians to pump therapy is low in many countries, while diabetes educators do not exist as an acknowledged entity in many European countries, and pump manufacturers are excluded from the education process of patients in most of them. Pump use in pediatric-age populations has strongly increased during the last years, following the evidence-based demonstrations of the benefits of pump therapy in these patients leading to an international consensus on pump indications and practice. Failure to control type 1 diabetes to target and frequent hypoglycemia under multiple daily insulin injections are consensus-based but restrictive indications for pump therapy in adults in most countries. The economic burden on healthcare insurance systems does not facilitate wider use of insulin pumps, but a significant expansion of pump therapy according to consensus-based indications is still expected thanks to the growing knowledge of physicians in technologies and because of the increasing interest of patients to use technology to improve their control of diabetes and health-related quality of life. More sophisticated technologies connected to pump therapy, such as continuous glucose monitoring or telemedicine, will need specific cost coverage for a true implementation in diabetes care in Europe.

Practical pearls in insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515302/),"
Much of the practice of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy is based on experience, case reports, and occasionally trial and error. This review describes the ""practical pearls"" that potentially could lead to improved diabetes control outcomes. Eight pearls are identified. First, ideally there is an efficient clinic/office system and infrastructure to efficiently manage this patient population. Second, assuring the patient is an appropriate pump candidate should increase the chances of success. This can include patient attitude. Next, understanding how to react to blood glucose data and how to match prandial insulin dosing to food intake are both important. CSII also has potential advantages for both the extremely insulin-sensitive patient (due to the ability to accurately infuse small doses of insulin) and the insulin-resistant patient (with the infusion of U-500 insulin). Finally, the introduction of bolus calculators and software to download the pumps has provided technology that when used appropriately can further benefit glycemic control.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a promising therapy, but the clinical evidence supporting it is mixed. Large randomized controlled trials have concluded that CSII was equivalent to multiple daily injections (MDI), whereas smaller trials have concluded that CSII was superior. Simpler insulin regimens of CSII have been investigated for T2DM and may lead to improved outcomes. Future directions in this area include simpler insulin pumps and the use of concentrated insulins (U-500), neither of which has left the feasibility stage of research. CSII may be appropriate for some people with T2DM, especially those for whom MDI therapy has failed.

Practical aspects and considerations when switching between continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and multiple daily injections.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20515298/),"
Insulin pump therapy is considered the gold standard for insulin management in patients requiring full physiologic insulin replacement. Compared to traditional delivery of short- and long-acting insulin preparations by multiple daily insulin injections, delivery of insulin via continuous subcutaneous infusion brings with it several advantages, which in the past have translated into better glycemic control and treatment satisfaction. Delivery of insulin via pump reduces the number needle insertions (from four or five per day to once every 2-3 days), allows for greater flexibility of insulin delivery with regard to both the basal and prandial component, facilitates portability of the insulin preparation, and allows for more accurate dosing. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion does have some drawbacks, including a greater risk of inadvertent insulin non-delivery, greater costs of therapy, and the need to be ""tethered"" with some systems that might be considered ""burdensome"" or even undesirable to some patients. For the most part patients who initiate insulin pump therapy are satisfied and continue using the technology, but there might be instances that arise that require the re-introduction of insulin delivery by pen or syringe. This article will review some of the reasons and strategies for switching from one mode of delivery to the other.

The automatic regulation of the basal dose on the insulin pump for the treatment of patients that have Diabetes type 1.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20507288/),"
Diabetes mellitus type 1 is a chronic metabolic disorder, and its main characteristic is Hyperglycemia. It usually occurs in the early years because of the absolute or relative absence of the active insulin that is caused by the autoimmune disease of the beta cells of the pancreas. Despite the numerous researches and efforts of the scientists, the therapy for Diabetes type 1 is based on the substitution of insulin. Even though the principles of the therapy have not changed so much, still some important changes have occurred in the production and usage of insulin. Lately, the insulin pumps are more frequent in the therapy for Diabetes type 1. The functioning of the pump is based on the continuing delivery of insulin in a small dose (""the basal dose""), that keeps the level of glycemia in the blood constant. The increase of glycemia during the meal is reduced with the additional dose of insulin (""the bolus dose""). The use of the insulin pumps and the continuing glucose sensors has provided an easier and more efficient monitoring of the diabetes, a better metabolic control and a better life quality for the patient and his/her family. This work presents the way of automatic regulation of the basal dose of insulin through the synthesis of the functions of the insulin pump and the continuing glucose sensor. The aim is to give a contribution to the development of the controlling algorithm on the insulin pump for the automatic regulation of the glucose concentration in the blood. This could be a step further which is closer to the delivery of the dose of insulin that is really needed for the basic needs of the organism, and a significant contribution is given to the development of the artificial pancreas.

Insulin pumps: from inception to the present and toward the future.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20456732/),"
As an alternative to the usual insulin injections, insulin pumps have been introduced as an advanced method of insulin delivery for managing type 1 diabetes mellitus patients. This review documents the history of insulin pump development and the production of 'smart pumps' that offer patients greater dosing accuracy, flexibility, and ease of use. This has resulted in an increase in the number of insulin pump users around the world. This paper also provides a comprehensive survey of the pumps currently available on the market and their specifications. Unique features of each product and the drawbacks are addressed in the review. The future direction of insulin pump development is targeted toward closing the loop, to allow feedback control between an insulin pump and a glucose sensor, and hence finer adjustment of insulin delivery rates as required.

Clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for diabetes: systematic review and economic evaluation.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20223123/),"
The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) was reviewing its previous guidance on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). The review provided an assessment of evidence which had been published since the previous NICE appraisal (TA 151) in 2007.
To examine the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of using CSII to treat diabetes. To update the previous assessment report by reviewing evidence that has emerged since the last appraisal, and to take account of developments in alternative therapies, in particular the long-acting analogue insulins, which cause fewer problems with hypoglycaemia.
A systematic review of the literature and an economic evaluation were carried out. The bibliographic databases used were MEDLINE and EMBASE, 2002 to June 2007. The Cochrane Library (all sections), the Science Citation Index (for meeting abstracts only) and the website of the 2007 American Diabetes Association were also searched.
The primary focus for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) was the comparison of CSII with multiple daily injection (MDI), based on the newer insulin analogues, but trials of neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)-based MDI that had been published since the last assessment were identified and described in brief. For type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), all trials of MDI versus CSII were included, whether the long-acting insulin was analogue or not, because there was no evidence that analogue-based MDI was better than NPH-based MDI. Trials that were shorter than 12 weeks were excluded. Information on the patients' perspectives was obtained from four sources: the submission from the pump users group--Insulin Pump Therapy (INPUT); interviews with parents of young children who were members of INPUT; some recent studies; and from a summary of findings from the previous assessment report. Economic modelling used the Center for Outcomes Research (CORE) model, through an arrangement with the NICE and the pump manufacturers, whose submission also used the CORE model.
The 74 studies used for analysis included eight randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of CSII versus analogue-based MDI in either T1DM or T2DM, eight new (since the last NICE appraisal) RCTs of CSII versus NPH-based MDI in T1DM, 48 observational studies of CSII, six studies of CSII in pregnancy, and four systematic reviews. The following benefits of CSII were highlighted: better control of blood glucose levels, as reflected by glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, with the size of improvement depending on the level before starting CSII; reduction in swings in blood glucose levels, and in problems due to the dawn phenomenon; fewer problems with hypoglycaemic episodes; reduction in insulin dose per day, thereby partly off-setting the cost of CSII; improved quality of life, including a reduction in the chronic fear of severe hypoglycaemia; more flexibility of lifestyle--no need to eat at fixed intervals, more freedom of lifestyle and easier participation in social and physical activity; and benefits for the patients' family. The submission from INPUT emphasised the quality of life gains from CSII, as well as improved control and fewer hypoglycaemic episodes. Also, there was a marked discrepancy between the improvement in social quality of life reported by successful pump users, and the lack of convincing health-related quality of life gains reported in the trials. With regard to economic evaluation, the main cost of CSII is for consumables, such as tubing and cannulas, and is about 1800-2000 pounds per year. The cost of the pump, assuming 4-year life, adds another 430-720 pounds per annum. The extra cost compared with analogue-based MDI averages 1700 pounds. Most studies, assuming a reduction in HbA1c level of 1.2%, found CSII to be cost-effective.
The most important weakness of the evidence was the very small number of randomised trials of CSII against the most modern forms of MDI, using analogue insulins.
Based on the totality of evidence, using observational studies to supplement the limited data from randomised trials against best MDI, CSII provides some advantages over MDI in T1DM for both children and adults. However, there was no evidence that CSII is better than analogue-based MDI in T2DM or in pregnancy. Further trials with larger numbers and longer durations comparing CSII and optimised MDI in adults, adolescents and children are needed. In addition, there should be a trial of CSII versus MDI with similar provision of structured education in both arms. A trial is also needed for pregnant women with pre-existing diabetes, to investigate using CSII to the best effect.

Insulin pump therapy in Moslem patients with type 1 diabetes during Ramadan fasting: an observational report.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20210567/),"
Many Moslem patients do observe the fast during Ramadan. There are limited data on insulin pump therapy during Ramadan. We report our experience with type 1 diabetes patients on insulin pumps during Ramadan 2008 (29 days).
A total of 63 patients were evaluated. Forty-nine patients fasted, and 14 elected not to fast. Those who fasted (24 males, 25 females) were 22 +/- 7 years of age (mean +/- SD) and had had diabetes for 9.6 +/- 5.6 years. Patients used the Medtronic (Northridge, CA) MiniMed 722 model and had been using pump therapy for 20 +/- 10 months. Outcome measures included number of days fasted, hypoglycemia, unusual hyperglycemia, and number of emergency hospital visits.
Thirty patients (61.2%) fasted the whole month with no problems, nine (18.4%) fasted 27-28 days, eight (16.3%) fasted 24-25 days, and two (4.1%) fasted 23 days. Nearly half of the patients decreased their basal insulin by 5-50% of their prefasting doses. Seventeen patients had hypoglycemia requiring breaking the fast. Fasting was broken on 55 out of 1,450 potential fasting days (3.8%). No severe hypoglycemia was reported by any patient. Unusual hyperglycemia was reported in nine patients (18.4%). Hospital visits were reported for one patient for hyperglycemia (a 16-year-old girl who disconnected her pump). Twelve patients had fructosamine levels measured both before and immediately after Ramadan; pre-Ramadan fructosamine level was 4.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/L, and the post-Ramadan value was 3.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L (P = 0.007).
Fasting during Ramadan is feasible in patients with type 1 diabetes using an insulin pump, with adequate counseling and support.

"STAR 3 randomized controlled trial to compare sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy with multiple daily injections in the treatment of type 1 diabetes: research design, methods, and baseline characteristics of enrolled subjects.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20210562/),"
Sensor-augmented pump therapy (SAPT) integrates real-time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and offers an alternative to multiple daily injections (MDI). Previous studies provide evidence that SAPT may improve clinical outcomes among people with type 1 diabetes. Sensor-Augmented Pump Therapy for A1c Reduction (STAR) 3 is a multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of SAPT to that of MDI in subjects with type 1 diabetes.
Subjects were randomized to either continue with MDI or transition to SAPT for 1 year. Subjects in the MDI cohort were allowed to transition to SAPT for 6 months after completion of the study. SAPT subjects who completed the study were also allowed to continue for 6 months. The primary end point was the difference between treatment groups in change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) percentage from baseline to 1 year of treatment. Secondary end points included percentage of subjects with HbA1c < or =7% and without severe hypoglycemia, as well as area under the curve of time spent in normal glycemic ranges. Tertiary end points include percentage of subjects with HbA1c < or =7%, key safety end points, user satisfaction, and responses on standardized assessments.
A total of 495 subjects were enrolled, and the baseline characteristics similar between the SAPT and MDI groups. Study completion is anticipated in June 2010.
Results of this randomized controlled trial should help establish whether an integrated RT-CGM and CSII system benefits patients with type 1 diabetes more than MDI.

Comparison of the post-meal glucose response to different insulin bolus waveforms in insulin pump- and pre-meal pramlintide-treated type 1 diabetes patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20105039/),"
Both pramlintide and insulin pump waveforms separately provide improved post-meal glucose control. However, when used together there may be a mismatch in actions leading to hypoglycemia. We studied the three currently available waveforms and a ""modified combination wave"" (MC) in pramlintide-treated patients. The MC was a ""square"" (SQ) wave combined with a ""standard"" (ST) bolus that was delayed 1 h into the mealtime.
Using the CGMS Gold (Medtronics, Northridge, CA) we measured the glucose response 0-4 h after the beginning of a meal and 15 min after the initiation of the insulin bolus wave and pramlintide (60 microg), bolus. Pump-treated type 1 diabetes subjects were randomized to one bolus waveform for one full day of three meals and then crossed over to the other bolus waveforms. In the first study nine subjects were randomized to the ST, SQ, or ""combination"" (C) wave consisting of a ST wave at the beginning of a SQ wave. In the second study nine subjects were randomized to SQ or MC.
With ST and C waves glucose fell approximately 40 mg/dL 0-2 h post-meal and then returned to baseline by the fourth hour. Initially isoglycemic, the SQ wave increased approximately 20 mg/dL in the late meal period. The MC demonstrated minimal (approximately 10 mg/dL) change during the entire post-meal period.
For currently available insulin pump bolus waves, SQ and MC may be least likely to cause hypoglycemia in pramlintide-treated patients.

Attitudes towards insulin pump therapy among adolescents and young people.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20082590/),"
This study investigated reasons for the rejection and discontinuation of insulin pump therapy and explored general attitudes towards this mode of therapy among young patients with type 1 diabetes.
A questionnaire was developed using a focus group of young people with diabetes. It was then used to survey a random sample of adolescents and young people identified by physicians specializing in diabetes care and participating in a voluntary quality improvement initiative in Germany. The physicians were also surveyed.
Eighty-eight patients participated in the survey (22 had never used the pump, 20 had formerly used the pump, and 46 were using the pump at that time, with an average age of between 20 and 22 years, depending on the group). Those who had never used the pump had had diabetes for a significantly shorter length of time and had undergone their first diabetes education more recently. Current pump users were significantly younger at the time of the first diabetes education. There were no significant differences between patients concerning where they obtained their information about the condition and treatment options. Although clinical factors were named, social and psychological factors were prominent as reasons both in reluctance to try the pump therapy and in discontinuing therapy. Technical problems as a disadvantage of the pump (aside from the catheter) were less likely to be named. Responses among physicians confirmed discipline and compliance were essential prerequisites for this therapy and supported findings that patients discontinuing pump therapy at their own request tend to do so for nonclinical reasons.
Although the technical reliability of the insulin pump was generally accepted by all patients regardless of current treatment, clinical disadvantages relating to the use of the pump but more commonly social/psychological factors were named, which resulted in patients being reluctant to try this therapy or discontinuing use of it.

Parental attitudes towards overnight closed-loop glucose control in children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20082583/),"
This study examined parental attitudes towards overnight closed-loop (CL) glucose control in children and young people with type 1 diabetes (T1D).
Twelve families recruited by the INsulin PUmp Therapy group (INPUT), a U.K. patient/carer-led support group for people with T1D, attended a focus meeting on CL. The concept of CL was explained, and clinical results and plans regarding the Artificial Pancreas Project at Cambridge were presented. Participants completed a questionnaire to evaluate parental feelings about T1D management and attitudes towards overnight CL insulin delivery.
Nineteen parents (12 mothers and seven fathers) anonymously completed the questionnaire. Main concerns about diabetes were related to long-term complications (84%) and hypoglycemia (16%). Achieving good glucose control represented major challenge for carers (83%) with nighttime being the most difficult period to manage (56%), worrying most parents (71%) particularly because of fear of hypoglycemia (33%). The development of CL to manage diabetes was welcomed by all parents (100%) with 95% happy for their child to wear a continuous glucose monitor together with an insulin pump. All parents were ready to respond to additional alarms at night with 90% parents not worried about their child's overnight insulin delivery being controlled by a computer.
Selected parents of children with T1D who are already insulin pump users express implied trust in the technology for overnight CL insulin delivery. Nighttime blood glucose control is the biggest challenge and concern for parents, and the development of a commercially available overnight CL system may be an important goal.

The education of patients in prandial insulin dosing related to the structure of bolus calculators.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21447273/),"
The metabolic effect of insulin pump therapy depends on precise adjustments of insulin to food intake ratio. Calculation of prandial insulin dose is a complex process employing many variant factors such as pre-prandial glucose and carbohydrate (CHO) levels, glucose index, insulin to CHO ratio (ICR) and active insulin. Bolus calculators are very effective in controlling blood glucose level in patients treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Most of modern bolus calculators are built into the insulin pump unit and are only accessible to pump users. In addition, some models offer nutrition database. Patients' education is an essential step in proper interpretation and application of bolus calculators' various algorithms.

Role of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in patients with recalcitrant diabetes in South India.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19905890/),"
We aimed to assess the effect of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in patients with ""recalcitrant diabetes"" whose glycemia had not been controlled adequately with multiple daily injections of insulin or insulin plus oral hypoglycemic agents.
We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of patients with diabetes who were initiated on insulin pump therapy at our center in India between 2002 and 2007. Data analysis included fasting and postprandial blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values, insulin requirement, body weight, and the occurrence of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis.
We studied 33 patients with diabetes (type 1 [n = 17] and type 2 [n = 16]) who were on CSII therapy for a mean duration of 3.4 years. A statistically significant reduction in HbA1c was found after initiating CSII (prepump 10.7% vs. postpump 8.3%, P < 0.001). The reduction was greater in type 1 patients (10.6 +/- 2.1 vs. 8.0 +/- 1.6%) than in type 2 patients (11.0 +/- 2.1 vs. 8.8 +/- 1.4%). There was a reduction in frequency of severe hypoglycemia after starting the CSII pump, and there were no instances of diabetic ketoacidosis.
Although HbA1c levels did not reach optimal targets, our data indicate that CSII is an effective therapy for patients with diabetes having recalcitrant diabetes who can afford this treatment and whose glycemia is poorly controlled with conventional therapies.

Compared to older children and adolescents very young patients with type 1 diabetes represent a unique population. We analyzed the age-dependent characteristics and parameters of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in children under 6 years of age with type 1 diabetes.
We evaluated metabolic control and pump-dependent characteristics in 46 children with type 1 diabetes after 0.89 +/- 0.62 years of CSII.
Metabolic control significantly improved after CSII initiation (glycosylated hemoglobin, 8.12 +/- 1.24% vs. 7.30 +/- 0.67%; P < 0.05), without increased risk for diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycemia. Interestingly, very young patients required bigger boluses than expected, especially in the morning and at the afternoon snack.
These data support the need to personalize pump-dependent characteristics, especially in very young children with type 1 diabetes, in order to optimize CSII therapy in this unique age group of patients.

Use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) therapy in the hospital: a review of one institution's experience.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19885284/),"
This article reviews the performance of our hospital's inpatient insulin pump policy.
Twenty-five hospital admissions of 21 unique patients receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy were reviewed.
Between November 1, 2005, and November 30, 2006, there were 25 hospital admissions involving 21 patients receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy. The average age and duration of diabetes among these 21 patients was 50 and 29 years, respectively; 67% were women, 90% had type 1 diabetes, and all were white. The mean length of hospital stay was 4 days, and the average reported length of insulin pump therapy was 4 years. Patients in 16 of the admissions were identified as candidates for continued use of the insulin pump during the hospital stay. Over 90% of patients remaining on the insulin pump had documentation by nursing of the presence of the pump at the time of admission; 100% of the patients had an admission glucose recorded; 88% had a record of signed patient consent; 81% had evidence of completed preprinted insulin pump orders; 75% received a required endocrine consultation; and 75% of cases had documentation of completed bedside flow sheet. A high frequency of both hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events occurred in the patients; however, no adverse events were related directly to the insulin pump.
Insulin pump therapy can be safely continued in the hospital setting. While staff compliance with required procedures was high, there was still room for improvement. More data are needed, however, on whether this method of insulin delivery is effective for controlling hyperglycemia in hospitalized patients.

Preventing hypoglycemia using predictive alarm algorithms and insulin pump suspension.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19848575/),"
Nocturnal hypoglycemia is a significant problem. From 50% to 75% of hypoglycemia seizures occur at night. Despite the development of real-time glucose sensors (real-time continuous glucose monitor [CGM]) with hypoglycemic alarms, many patients sleep through these alarms. The goal of this pilot study was to assess the feasibility using a real-time CGM to discontinue insulin pump therapy when hypoglycemia was predicted.
Twenty-two subjects with type 1 diabetes had two daytime admissions to a clinical research center. On the first admission their basal insulin was increased until their blood glucose level was <60 mg/dL. On the second admission hypoglycemic prediction algorithms were tested to determine if hypoglycemia was prevented by a 90-min pump shutoff and to determine if the pump shutoff resulted in rebound hyperglycemia.
Using a statistical prediction algorithm with an 80 mg/dL threshold and a 30-min projection horizon, hypoglycemia was prevented 60% of the time. Using a linear prediction algorithm with an 80 mg/dL threshold and a 45-min prediction horizon, hypoglycemia was prevented 80% of the time. There was no rebound hyperglycemia following pump suspension.
Further development of algorithms is needed to prevent all episodes of hypoglycemia from occurring.

Thirty youths (9 to 18 years old) had at least 4 HbA(1c) values. Nineteen youths who achieved glycemic control had three different patterns during 12 months of insulin pump therapy. Eleven youths who did not achieve glycemic control had two different patterns. Multiple factors can influence a youth's glycemic control. Uncontrolled blood glucose levels increase the individual's risk for developing type 1 diabetes complications. Youths and health care providers need to work as a team to identify factors affecting the youth's glycemic control and discuss changes.

Reduction of glycosylated hemoglobin following 6 months of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in an Indian population with type 2 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19698065/),"
The standard treatment regimen for insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes is multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin, but continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with an insulin pump offers more flexibility and the possibility of a reduced total daily insulin dose. Few studies have investigated CSII for type 2 diabetes, and none has focused on an Asian Indian population.
Subjects with type 2 diabetes who were previously using MDI were switched to CSII. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body weight, and total daily insulin dose were recorded at baseline (MDI) and after 6 months of CSII. Subjects were also asked to rate their satisfaction with CSII and the treatment's interference in their daily activities after 6 months.
A total of 46 subjects received CSII. Mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.5% after 6 months. This outcome was statistically significant (P < 0.0063; 95% confidence interval, 0.161-0.921%). There was no statistically significant change in body weight or total insulin daily dose. Subjects reported high satisfaction with CSII and low interference with daily activities.
Six months of CSII in Asian Indian subjects with type 2 diabetes resulted in a statistically and clinically significant change in HbA1c.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion versus multiple daily injections.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19561778/),"
Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Multiple Daily insulin Injections (MDI) are both strategies aiming to achieve a tight glycemic and metabolic control. However, the choice between them remains controversial. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of MDI (three or more injections daily) with CSII on glycemic control in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and assess satisfaction from treatment in the CSII group.
Seventeen patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus on CSII (previously on MDI) and 17 patients on MDI, matched for age, gender, BMI and duration of diabetes, were retrospectively studied. Glucosylated Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), frequency of hypoglycaemias (assessed as self reported episodes), BMI and total units of insulin per day were evaluated at baseline and after 6 months in both groups. CSII group completed a questionnaire concerning motive for treatment selection, advantages, deficiencies and inconvenience at the end of the study. Satisfaction from treatment was assessed with a scale from 0 to10.
CSII group had more hypoglycaemic episodes at baseline than MDI group (16.2+/-2.8 vs 2.8+/-1.3, p<0,001). HbA1c (8.4+/-0.5 before vs 7.3+/-0.4 after, p<0.05) and total hypoglycaemic episodes per month (16.2+/-2.8 before vs 8.7+/-2.3 after, p<0.05) significantly decreased in CSII group 6 months after baseline. On the contrary, total hypoglycaemic episodes per month were increased in MDI group (2.8+/-1.3 before vs 10.8 +/-2,6 after, p<0.05) in order to maintain HbA1c levels. No significant differences were observed in BMI in both groups. Total insulin demands were reduced in the CSII group (49.4+/-3.3 before vs 39.0+/-4.6 after, p<0.05) and remained unchanged in MDI group. None of the patients discontinued CSII therapy, while overall satisfaction rate in this group was high. The main motive for CSII selection was frequent hypoglycaemic episodes and glucose fluctuations (10/17). The majority of patients expressed their wish for incorporating glucose trend indicator and/or continuous glucose measurement into pump and reducing pump size (15/17). Most commonly stated advantage was improved flexibility, followed by greater freedom and decreased sense of physical restrictions (10/17). Inconvenience mainly derived from alarm malfunction and catheter or needle occlusion and was reported from a minority of patients (4/17).
CSII group reported more hypoglycaemias than MDI group at baseline but 6 months later had significantly less hypoglycaemic events, while on the contrary, MDI group 6 months after baseline had more frequent and more severe hypoglycaemias. Although baseline hypoglycaemias are not equal between the two groups, we can assume that CSII group achieved less hypoglycaemic events along with significant reduction in HbA1c while utilising less insulin units.

"Effect of a local heating device on insulin and glucose pharmacokinetic profiles in an open-label, randomized, two-period, one-way crossover study in patients with type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19539098/),"
Reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia is a major challenge in the treatment of patients with diabetes. Studies suggest that heating the insulin injection site may accelerate insulin absorption. InsuPatch (InsuLine Medical Ltd., Petach-Tikva, Israel) is a device intended to accelerate subcutaneous insulin delivery using an insulin pump by locally warming the infusion site.
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of the InsuPatch device on the pharmacokinetics of short-acting insulin analogues and on postprandial glycemia.
This was an open-label, randomized, 2-period, 1-way crossover study using a meal tolerance test (MTT) protocol in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 18 to 65 years with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) of 6% to 12%, who were using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy (insulin lispro or aspart). A bolus of insulin 0.15 U/kg was delivered immediately before a standardized liquid meal. The effect of the device on insulin absorption and postprandial glucose excursions was tested by measuring blood glucose and insulin concentration profiles with and without the operation of the device. Adverse events (AEs) were monitored during the 2 study visits. The infusion site was visually inspected at the end of each study. All AEs were recorded in the case-report form.
The MTT protocol was performed in 17 white patients with type 1 diabetes (sex, male/female, 7/10; mean age, 31.8 years [range, 18-53 years]; mean body mass index, 25.6 kg/m(2) [range, 20.0-39.4 kg/m(2)]; and mean HbA(1c), 7.1% [range, 5.8%-9.3%]). The mean (SD) postprandial glucose excursion AUC at 120 minutes after the meal was significantly reduced in the group that used the device compared with the group that did not (104 [65] vs 155 [56] mg/dL/h; P < 0.005). Plasma insulin was measured randomly in 9 of the 17 subjects. Use of the device was associated with significant reductions in mean (SD) T(max) (45 [28] vs 78 [35] minutes) and time to half-maximum concentration (T(50%max)) (20 [11] vs 28 [10] minutes; both, P < 0.05). Insulin AUC increased significantly in the group that used the device compared with the group that did not at 30 (21 [6] vs 33 [16] mU/L/h), 60 (55 [12] vs 80 [28] mU/L/h), and 90 (93 [19] vs 118 [31] mU/L/h) minutes after administration (all, P < 0.05). Cmax also increased significantly (118 [35] vs 86 [16] mU/L [38%]; P < 0.05).
In this pilot study, use of the InsuPatch was associated with significant decreases in T(max) and T(50%max) and increases in insulin AUC and C(max) of subcutaneous infused rapid-acting insulin analogues, resulting in a lower postprandial glucose excursion in these patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated with CSII.

Patients were categorized in 3 groups on the basis of evidence in the medical records for IIPP in combination with inpatient diabetes service consultation (group 1; n = 34), for IIPP alone (group 2; n = 12), or for usual care (group 3; n = 4). Patients identified during hospital admission as using CSII therapy were invited to complete a satisfaction questionnaire for inpatient CSII use.
Mean CBG levels were similar among the 3 groups (groups 1, 2, and 3: 173 +/- 43 mg/dL versus 187 +/- 62 mg/dL versus 218 +/- 46 mg/dL, respectively). Although there were more patient-days with blood glucose >300 mg/dL in group 3 (P = .02), there were no significant group differences in the frequency of hypoglycemia (CBG <70 mg/dL). Only 1 pump malfunction and 1 infusion site problem were reported among all study patients. No serious adverse events related to CSII therapy occurred. The majority of patients (86%) reported satisfaction with their ability to continue CSII use in the hospital.
Patients using CSII as outpatients are candidates for inpatient diabetes self-management. Inexperience with these devices on the part of hospital personnel together with the limited studies of patient experience with CSII in the hospital contributes to inconsistencies in management of these patients. An IIPP provides a standardized and safe approach to the use of CSII in the hospital.

[Insulin pump for treatment of children and adolescents with diabetes].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19488090/),"
The goals for metabolic control of children and adolescents with diabetes are stricter than previously. The purpose of the study was to compare two ways of administering insulin; i.e. multi-injection and continuous subcutaneous infusion, with respect to metabolic control and patient satisfaction.
The study material consisted of all patients with type I diabetes, treated at the paediatric outpatient clinic, Innlandet Hospital Trust (Lillehammer), Norway in the period 1995 - 2004 (i.e. 5 years before and 5 years after insulin pumps became available). Patient information was retrieved from medical records and the Norwegian benchmarking study on paediatric diabetes (a national monitoring programme for children and adolescents with diabetes). Measures of disease control were glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), incidence of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycemia, and patient satisfaction in terms of patient preference.
80 patients were included in the study. Mean HbA1c was unchanged during the first 5-year period, but gradually decreased from 9.1 (SD 1.6 ) to 8.3 (SD 0.9) as the proportion of patients on continuous infusion increased. Mean HbA1c tended to be lower for pump users, but there was no change in the frequency of ketoacidosis or hospitalization due to hypoglycemia. 76 % of patients used an insulin pump at the end of the study. One patient reverted to multi-injections.
The study suggests that insulin pumps compare well with multi-injections with respect to safety and disease control and that most children and adolescents prefer the pumps.

Effects of moderate-severe exercise on blood glucose in Type 1 diabetic adolescents treated with insulin pump or glargine insulin.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19474521/),"
Few papers focus on exercise-related blood glucose (BG) in patients on continuous sc insulin infusion (CSII) or multiple daily injections (MDI) with glargine.
The main objective was to evaluate the degree of glycemic control in Type 1 diabetes mellitus adolescents on CSII doing physical activity with pump switched on or off. These findings were also compared with a small group of patients on MDI with glargine.
Eight patients on CSII (basal rate continued or turned off in alternating sessions) and 5 on MDI joined 4 sessions of moderate-severe exercise.
Post-exercise BG significantly increased with the pump off and was unchanged/decreased with the pump on and MDI groups vs baseline. The hypoglycemia rate was not different among the 3 groups at any time. Pump on: hypoglycemias more frequent both at bedtime (p=0.031) and at awakening (p<0.001) than before dinner and at awakening than at bed-time (p=0.044). Pump off: hypoglycemias more frequent both at bed-time (p=0.010) and at awakening (p=0.031) than before dinner. MDI: no differences.
Glargine is safe and reducing the pre-lunch insulin is unnecessary. Subjects on insulin pump should not stop the basal rate. If they stop the pump, some actions are advisable: pre-exercise insulin bolus, pre-sleeping snack rich in carbohydrates, slight reduction of the overnight basal rate. On the other hand, if the basal rate is unmodified, the ingestion of sugary drinks during the exercise, the reduction of the overnight basal rate, a reduction of the pre-dinner insulin bolus and/or a pre-sleeping snack should be considered.

Benefits of three-month continuous glucose monitoring for persons with diabetes using insulin pumps and sensors.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19365526/),"
The latest Paradigm 722 insulin pump, Medtronic MiniMed, USA, enables daily reading of 288 interstitial fluid glucose concentrations determined by a sensor inserted into subcutaneous tissue; the sensor signals are transmitted into the insulin pump, enabling the patient to see real-time glucose concentration on the display and adapt further treatment.
To assess the evolution of HbA1c over the course of a 3-month period in two cohorts of persons with type 1 (n=39) or type 2 (n=3) diabetes (PWD): 1) PWD on Paradigm 722 using sensors for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM group), 2) PWD on other types of insulin pumps performing intensive self-monitoring as before (3 to 6 times/d) on glucometer Linus, Wellion, Agamatrix (control group).
Compliant PWDs using insulin pump with insulin aspart for several previous months were included in the study. Seventeen were put on Paradigm 722 with CGM and 25 were included in the control group. Paired t-test and the statistical program SPSS v.15.0 were used to analyze the data.
There was no significant difference in age between the two groups (P=0.996), in diabetes duration (P=0.482) or in daily insulin dose (P=0.469). In the CGM group (but not in the control group) HbA1c/IFCC dropped from 6.98+/-0.43 % to 5.98+/-0.36 % (P=0.006) within 1 month and remained reduced.
The use of the Paradigm 722 insulin pump with CGM resulted in significant improvement in HbA1c which appeared within one month and remained throughout the whole 3-month study period. No significant improvement in HbA1c was seen in the control group.

Insulin pump therapy: guidelines for successful outcomes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19318690/),"
Current forms of insulin delivery used in the treatment of diabetes mellitus (diabetes) include syringes, pens, and insulin pumps. Technical advantages of insulin pump therapy, or continuous subcutaneous insulin delivery (CSII), include precise and flexible insulin dosing. In the context of intensive diabetes management, insulin pumps can facilitate improved long-term glycemic control and reduce the risk for diabetes complications, with improved lifestyle flexibility for patients and their families. Comprehensive patient education, carbohydrate counting, and frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose or continuous glucose monitoring are necessary components of successful insulin pump therapy. Technological advances have increased the appeal of pump therapy to patients and clinicians. Physically, current insulin pumps are discreet, ergonomic, and water resistant. Meanwhile, software improvements have yielded smart pumps with features that support pump users in their daily diabetes management. Robust data analysis software packages allow patients and clinicians unprecedented insight into the quality of diabetes control. Furthermore, widespread insurance reimbursement for CSII has expanded access to therapy.
As the number of pump users and potential users expands, diabetes educators face new challenges and opportunities to improve patients' lives with diabetes. This activity describes the rationale for insulin pump therapy, its potential advantages and disadvantages, and strategies regarding patient selection and education.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (insulin pump) therapy can be safely used in the hospital in select patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19211393/),"
To analyze data on inpatient insulin pump use and examine staff compliance with hospital procedures, glycemic control, and safety.
We conducted a retrospective review of charts and bedside glucose data for patients who had been receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy and were admitted to our teaching hospital between November 1, 2005, and February 8, 2008.
During the study period, there were 50 hospitalizations involving 35 patients who had been receiving outpatient insulin pump therapy. The mean age and duration of diabetes of the 35 patients was 55 years and 32 years, respectively. Sixty-six percent were women, and 91% had type 1 diabetes. Patients in 31 of the hospitalizations (62%) were deemed candidates for continued insulin pump therapy during their stay. Of the 31 hospitalizations, 80% had the presence of the pump documented at admission; 100% had an admission glucose value; 77% had documentation of signed patient consent; 81% had evidence of completed preprinted insulin pump orders; 77% received an endocrine consultation; and 68% had a completed bedside flow sheet. Patients continuing insulin pump therapy had mean bedside glucose levels similar to those whose pump therapy was discontinued (P = .11); however, the proportion of hypoglycemic events was lower among insulin pump users (P<.01) than among nonusers.
Insulin pump therapy is safe for select inpatients. Overall, staff compliance with procedures was high, although we identified areas for improvement. Continued study is needed on the effectiveness of insulin pump therapy in controlling inpatient hyperglycemia.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy: A primer on insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19196588/),"
To summarize the role, benefits, and risks of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy for treating diabetes.
A literature search was conducted in Medline (1996 to July 2008) using the search terms intensive insulin therapy, insulin pump, and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Reference lists from comprehensive review articles were also used to identify additional original research publications.
Review articles and studies evaluating the role, benefits, and risks of CSII.
More than 300,000 individuals use CSII to treat diabetes. Many experts believe that CSII is the best insulin delivery method for highly motivated patients with type 1 diabetes who are technologically savvy and have the means to pay for the device and infusion sets. CSII is also useful for patients with type 2 diabetes who require multiple daily injections and experience wide fluctuations in blood glucose throughout the day or who experience severe hypoglycemia. A variety of CSII systems are currently available. All CSII systems provide precise insulin delivery throughout the day and improve the accuracy of bolus dose calculations, thereby achieving improved glycemic control with less frequent and severe hypoglycemic episodes. Patients who choose CSII report improved quality of life. Potential risks associated with CSII include mechanical problems leading to diabetes ketoacidosis, infections at the infusion site, hypoglycemia, and lipodystrophy.
CSII is an attractive treatment option for many patients with diabetes. Given the widespread use of CSII, all health professionals should be familiar with the basic features of insulin pump technology, the potential risks and benefits of CSII, and how to troubleshoot common problems.

Adjusting the basal insulin regimen of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus receiving insulin pump therapy during the Ramadan fast: A case series in adolescents and adults.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24692830/),"
Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, is the holy month of fasting for adolescent and adult Muslims. Observance of Ramadan is considered obligatory for every healthy adult Muslim. During this time, Muslims refrain from eating, drinking, smoking, and administering oral or parenteral medications from sunrise to sunset daily for 28 to 30 days.
We evaluated the need for changes in basal insulin regimen in 5 patients (4 males and 1 female; age range, 15-19 years) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) who fasted during Ramadan. The patients were receiving insulin pump therapy with regular human insulin and maintained weekly visits with their endocrinologist at The Chronic Care Center (Beirut, Lebanon). They were instructed to break the fast after any episode of hypoglycemia (finger stick glucose <70 mg/dL) or severe hyperglycemia (finger stick glucose ≥300 mg/dL or any hyperglycemia associated with presence of urine ketone bodies on urinary dipstick). Blood glucose concentrations did not change significantly with fasting. Finger stick blood glucose taken at 4-hour intervals decreased in the afternoon (at 4 pm) and increased in the evening and morning (10 pm and 8 am, respectively) during this month in 4 of 5 patients, while no significant change in circadian rhythm of finger stick blood glucose was observed in 1 patient. Based on the investigators' findings, the basal insulin requirement decreased by 5.5% to 25.0% (4 patients) or did not change (1 patient) during the fast. Changes in regimens, based on collaboration between the endocrinologist and diabetes educational nurse, were determined by blood glucose self-monitoring done at 4-hour intervals during the fasting period, pre-Suhur (predawn breakfast), and ≥2 hours after Iftar (evening fast-breaking meal). No cases of keto-acidosis or severe hypoglycemia were reported.
These 5 adolescent and adult patients with T1DM who were using an insulin pump were able to fast during Ramadan without incidences of severe hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis by using close blood glucose self-monitoring and weekly follow-up with their endocrine team, which consisted of an endocrinologist, a registered nutritionist, and a diabetes educational nurse.

Patient-reported outcomes for an integrated real-time continuous glucose monitoring/insulin pump system.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19132857/),"
A 16-week, two-site study evaluated outcomes for a new device (the Paradigm 722 System, Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA) that combines a ""smart"" continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump with real-time (RT) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and CareLinktrade mark data management software (DMS).
CSII-naive adults with type 1 diabetes in suboptimal control (mean glycosylated hemoglobin [A1C] = 8.6%) were randomized to the control arm, consisting of multiple daily injections (MDI) and self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), or the study arm (CSII with RT-CGM as an adjunct to SMBG). Participants (n = 28) completed the validated Insulin Delivery System Rating Questionnaire (IDSRQ) and the parallel Blood Glucose (BG) Monitoring System Rating Questionnaire (BGMSRQ) at study start and end. Participants in the study arm (n = 14) also completed newly developed User Acceptance Questionnaires (UAQs) for CSII, RT-CGM, and DMS at study end.
A1C reduction from study start to end was significant (P < 0.05) in both arms (-1.7% for study arm;-1.0% for control arm); there was no significant change in weight in either arm. The IDSRQ showed significantly (P < 0.05) greater benefit for the study arm in convenience, acceptability of BG monitoring requirements, BG control efficacy, diabetes worries, and interpersonal hassles, as well as higher overall satisfaction/preference. The BGMSRQ showed significantly (P < 0.05) greater benefit for the study arm in the BG monitoring system's ability to help manage glycemic control and less interest in changing to another BG monitoring system. The Study Arm UAQs showed positive ratings of system features.
Several patient-reported outcomes were significantly more positive in the study arm than the control arm; none was significantly more positive in the control arm. The features of the integrated RT-CGM/CSII system were frequently used and highly rated by participants, with high user satisfaction.

Twelve consecutive Type 1, insulin pump treated, diabetic patients followed in the high risk maternal - fetal clinic were ascertained. Data regarding glucose control was assessed and correlated with pregnancy outcome.
A total of 14 deliveries (10 singleton) were assessed. There were no miscarriages, one baby that was born with a ventricular septal defect (VSD). Glycemic control was within the acceptable guidelines. HbA1c (%) by trimesters: 6.5 +/- 0.9, 5.9 +/- 0.7, 5.8 +/- 0.6 and average glucose (mg/dL) 121.0 +/- 15.2, 114.8 +/- 13.2, 116.0 +/- 21.1. Average birth weight was 3312.1 +/- 750.2 g with five babies (35%) weighting over 4.0 kg at birth. Birth weight was significantly correlated with HbA1c at the first trimester, mean glucose at trimester 1 and 2, and maternal weight at delivery (r = 0.74, p = 0.045; r = 0.72, p = 0.051; r = 0.74, p = 0.046; r = 0.74, p = 0.04, respectively).
Our study of a limited number of patients suggest that women with pre-gestational diabetes obtaining acceptable glycemic goals with insulin pump therapy have increased risk of macrosomia. Current glycemic goals and therapies in treating pre-gestational diabetic patients therefore might not be sufficient to normalise pregnancy outcomes in of women with pre-gestational diabetes.

CSII and finger blood sugar test. On the second day CGMS was used for 72 hours. Logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation among different factors.
CGMS discovered 31 hypoglycemic events in 18 patients in the early stage of CSII treatment, 20 events occurring at night, a number significantly higher than that by self-monitoring of blood sugar. The C-peptide and mean blood glucose (BMG) of the patients with hypoglycemia.were significantly lower than those of the patients without hypoglycemia, and the total cholesterol, standard deviation of blood glucose (SDBG), and insulin pump basal rate of the patients with hypoglycemia were significantly higher than those of the patients without hypoglycemia (all P < 0.05). Multiple regression indicated that MBG was negatively correlated with hypoglycemia but SDBG and basal rate were positively correlated with hypoglycemia.
(1) Hypoglycemia detected by CGMS occurs in about 1/3 of the type 2 diabetes patients at the early stage of CSII therapy. (2) In addition of MBG and insulin pump basal rate, glycemic excursion is related closely to hypoglycemia.

Treatment of diabetes mellitus using an external insulin pump in clinical practice.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18951117/),"
Before the initiation of insulin pump therapy, patients must be aware of the different aspects of this form of intensive insulin therapy. Most healthcare professionals recommend a sequential approach to inform patients about CSII. Factors that need to be considered in choosing an insulin pump include its safety features, durability of the device, tolerability and comfort of the catheter, user-friendliness, technical features and appearance. The initial insulin requirements need to be individualized for the given patient, using different methods to determine the appropriate dosages for the basal rate and prandial boluses. Glycaemic targets and algorithms for insulin dose adaptation need to be learned by the patients to enable them to avoid and/or correct hypo- and hyperglycaemia/ketosis episodes. Patients are also advised on how to carry out frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose-and of ketone bodies, if necessary. Insulin pumps are now able to deliver a range of basal rates and boluses that increase the flexibility of CSII. One specific issue is the approach to meal-planning, based on carbohydrate-counting or the equivalent: this method of so-called 'flexible insulin therapy' can improve metabolic control (for instance, by diminishing postprandial excursions) as well as the quality of life of patients. Evaluation of the knowledge and practices of the patient can be made through a continuous educational programme carried out by experienced nurses and physicians at the start of therapy and during follow-up. In addition, it may be necessary to identify the reasons for lack of improvement in metabolic control after several months of therapy, which include pump malfunction, cannula problems, miscalculated insulin dosages and insufficient metabolic control in specific clinical situations with a high risk of metabolic deterioration (illness, exercise, concomitant drugs). Annual assessment of the patient using an itemized checklist is required to verify the continued efficacy and safety of insulin pump therapy, two main factors of success with CSII treatment.

Treatment of diabetes mellitus using an external insulin pump: the state of the art.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18951116/),"
The aim of diabetes treatment is to achieve tight glucose control to avoid the development of chronic diabetic complications while reducing the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external pump is an intensive diabetes therapy recognized to improve metabolic control and glycaemic instability, and to reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia. For years, the theoretical advantages of the insulin pump (constancy of basal delivery, adjustable basal rates, and low insulin depots allowing the reduction of glycaemic variability) have contributed to its reported superiority compared with multiple daily injections (MDI). However, insulin pump therapy is now challenged by new MDI regimens based on long-acting insulin analogues that could replace the use of CSII. As a consequence, health professionals now have to determine which patients are likely to benefit the most from CSII. Recently, several studies reported that children and adolescents, and patients whose blood glucose imbalance was initially the most pronounced with basal-bolus regimens, would particularly benefit from CSII. Other indications were also proposed in marginal clinical situations with highly selected patients in whom a significant improvement of blood glucose was demonstrated. Finally, the use of CSII in type 2 diabetic patients now appears to be a good alternative to the ineffective MDI regimens observed in some of these patients. However, past experience with CSII indicates that candidates for insulin pump therapy must be carefully selected and strongly motivated to improve their glucose control. Use of CSII also requires strict medical supervision by physicians and a regular programme of patient education by paramedical teams, to ensure optimal responsible use of this technique by healthcare professionals.

The exact mechanisms related to the development of localized lipoatrophy in the insulin injection area are unknown. In cases of lipoatrophy the beneficial therapeutic approach is to change the insulin molecule. With switching from one insulin analogue to another administered in insulin pump and changing the sites of insulin injections no progression of the lipoatrophic lesions was observed. Unfortunately, only decrease but no total regression of the formed lesions was achieved and future studies are needed to establish the method of treatment of localized lipoatrophy in children treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.

The aim of this randomised controlled study was to compare continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using an insulin pump with the traditional continuous intravenous infusion method for tight glycaemic control. Sixty patients admitted to our University Hospital medical intensive care unit with an initial blood glucose level over 6.1 mmol/l, were enrolled and randomised into two treatment groups: the subcutaneous insulin group received continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and the intravenous group received insulin by traditional intravenous infusion with infusers. Three patients died in the first 24 hours and were excluded from the final analysis. Insulin therapy was administered to both groups according to the previously designed and used protocol in the department. The target glucose level was 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/l. There was no significant difference in mortality between the groups. However mean blood glucose level was found to be lower (6.56+/-0.82 mmol/l vs. 7.85+/-1.6 mmol/l, P=0.00055) in the subcutaneous insulin group. According to Vogelzang's hyperglycaemic index, better glycaemic control was achieved in the subcutaneous insulin group while there was no significant difference in terms of hypoglycaemic events. Daily insulin bolus and infusion requirements were also significantly lower in the subcutaneous insulin group. Despite the small number of patients involved in this study in a medical intensive care unit, strict blood glucose control using a subcutaneous insulin pump was achieved more efficiently than the traditional intravenous infusion method without increasing hypoglycaemic events.

The benefits of insulin pump therapy on the metabolic control of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been reported. Such reports have prompted our interest to investigate the long-term metabolic effects of insulin pump therapy at our institution.
We retrospectively analyzed the management of type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients who began extended insulin pump therapy at Changhua Christian Hospital between November 2004 and October 2007. One-way ANOVA and post hoc analysis were used to compare baseline glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) values with subsequent values.
We studied 12 patients who were on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy at the time of data collection. Mean duration of CSII therapy was 2.3 years. A reduction in HbA1C was found after administering CSII, which was sustained after 1, 2 and 3 years of therapy (7.0%, 6.7% and 6.6%, respectively), with statistical significance (p<0.05). No incidence of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis occurred during the treatment period.
Our preliminary experience demonstrated the effectiveness of insulin pump therapy for both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. The reduction in their HbA1C values was both statistically and clinically significant. This treatment should be considered for patients poorly controlled by subcutaneous insulin injection therapy.

Use of case-based reasoning to enhance intensive management of patients on insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19885236/),"
This study was conducted to develop case-based decision support software to improve glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) on insulin pump therapy. While the benefits of good glucose control are well known, achieving and maintaining good glucose control remains a difficult task. Case-based decision support software may assist by recalling past problems in glucose control and their associated therapeutic adjustments.
Twenty patients with T1DM on insulin pumps were enrolled in a 6-week study. Subjects performed self-glucose monitoring and provided daily logs via the Internet, tracking insulin dosages, work, sleep, exercise, meals, stress, illness, menstrual cycles, infusion set changes, pump problems, hypoglycemic episodes, and other events. Subjects wore a continuous glucose monitoring system at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Clinical data were interpreted by physicians, who explained the relationship between life events and observed glucose patterns as well as treatment rationales to knowledge engineers. Knowledge engineers built a prototypical system that contained cases of problems in glucose control together with their associated solutions.
Twelve patients completed the study. Fifty cases of clinical problems and solutions were developed and stored in a case base. The prototypical system detected 12 distinct types of clinical problems. It displayed the stored problems that are most similar to the problems detected, and offered learned solutions as decision support to the physician.
This software can screen large volumes of clinical data and glucose levels from patients with T1DM, identify clinical problems, and offer solutions. It has potential application in managing all forms of diabetes.

Insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes: the Italian viewpoint.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18551824/),"
A panel of experts of the Italian Society of Paediatric Endocrinology and Diabetology translated into Italian the international insulin pump therapy recommendations in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
After an extensive review of the literature using evidence-based recommendations, several issues were taken into account, such as patient selection, advantages and disadvantages, instrument choice, insulin type, therapy planning and follow-up, emergencies, nutrition, particular occasions (like parties, holidays, sick days, travels), exercise, continuous glucose monitoring and integrated system, neonatal diabetes. The panel evaluated the cost-effectiveness of insulin pump therapy compared to multiple daily injection therapy, analysing the cost-benefit ratio.
Some tweak was needed due to the Italian dietetic singularity, meal schedule, climate and lifestyle. Insulin pump therapy in neonatal diabetes is a new issue and no guidelines have been published yet for this age-group. Moreover, legal issues according to the Italian law have been added and are peculiarity of our recommendations. An ""informed therapeutic agreement"" between the patient and his/her family and the diabetic team has to be signed before starting insulin pump therapy.
We think that nowadays the need for clinical guidelines is important and worth the effort that all countries develop faithful adaptation into their local languages taking into account specific contexts and local peculiarities, without making substantial modifications to the original text.

Use of rapid-acting insulin analogues in the treatment of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus: insulin pump therapy versus multiple daily injections.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18191065/),"
Replicating endogenous insulin production is the goal of treatment for diabetes mellitus (DM) and is necessary to minimize the risk of vascular complications. The 2 main methods of achieving this goal are continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple daily injections (MDIs) comprising basal and prandial injections.
The objective of this article was to discuss the use of a rapid-acting insulin analogue, insulin aspart, in CSII and MDI compared with other insulins in adult patients with type 1 or type 2 DM.
This article was based on a presentation given by the author at a satellite symposium entitled ""Realising the Value of Modern Insulins: Reaching Further with Rapid-Acting Insulin Analogues"" that was convened during the XIXth World Diabetes Congress, December 3, 2006, in Cape Town, South Africa.
In patients with type 1 DM, CSII using the rapid-acting insulin analogue insulin aspart has been reported in clinical trials to improve glycemic control compared with MDI therapy using neutral protamine Hagedorn plus insulin aspart (for basal and mealtime coverage, respectively). In patients with type 2 DM, the CSII and MDI regimens offered similar efficacy and tolerability; CSII therapy may be less burdensome, however, with fewer social limitations than MDIs. Not all insulins are equally suited for use in CSII treatment. Although the efficacy of insulin aspart in CSII was comparable to other rapid-acting insulins, the frequency of hypoglycemia was shown to be significantly lower with insulin aspart compared with human insulin or insulin lispro in patients with type 1 DM. The compatibility of insulin aspart and insulin lispro for use in CSII pumps was compared in an 8-week, double-blind, 2-period, crossover study of patients with type 1 DM. The overall adverse-effect score was significantly lower (P<0.005) with insulin aspart than with insulin lispro, as were scores for pain/burning and inflammation (both, P<0.01) and dermal redness (P<0.001). Furthermore, a stability study reported on the suitability of insulin aspart for use in CSII pumps. Quality-of-life scores with CSII have been reported to be higher than with MDI therapy.
CSII with the rapid-acting insulin analogue insulin aspart is a viable choice for patients with type 1 or type 2 DM who want close-to-physiologic insulin treatment.

Adolescent use of insulin and patient-controlled analgesia pump technology: a 10-year Food and Drug Administration retrospective study of adverse events.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18450857/),"
From January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration received 5 adolescent death reports associated with the use of insulin pumps, raising concerns about use of this device in this age group. To understand better the types of infusion pump-related problems in adolescents, we performed a comprehensive evaluation of insulin and patient-controlled analgesic pump-related adverse events reported for adolescents that were received by the Food and Drug Administration from 1996 to 2005.
A search for medical device adverse event reports from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2005, involving insulin pumps or patient-controlled analgesic pumps used by patients who were aged 12 to 21 years was conducted in the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience Database. Reports were reviewed for demographic characteristics, type of adverse event, and patient morbidity, and potential contributory factors were classified from narratives in the reports.
A total of 1674 reports were identified: 1594 for insulin pumps and 53 for patient-controlled analgesic pumps. In reports of insulin pump events, there were 13 reported deaths, 2 reports that indicated possible suicide attempts, and several additional reports indicating severe hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events that seemed to be device-related. A total of 102 (6.4%) insulin-pump reports highlighted factors that may have contributed to the adverse event, including problems associated with compliance, education, sports-related activities, and dropping or damaging the pump. Eighty-two percent of cases involving the insulin pump resulted in hospitalization. Half of the reports involving patient-controlled analgesic pumps indicated that the patient received an excess of medication; tampering and noncompliance were evident in some cases.
Adolescents are a special population who deserve careful consideration of risk and benefit for use of device technology. Studies need to further identify safety problems in this age group.

Laboratory-based non-clinical comparison of occlusion rates using three rapid-acting insulin analogs in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion catheters using low flow rates.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19885209/),"
Rapid-acting analog insulin is used increasingly for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy (CSII). As the choice of insulin may be a determinant of catheter occlusion, we compared rates of early and late occlusion of a standard CSII catheter with three insulin analogs in a laboratory-based setting.
Twenty-four pumps were used for the study. Each insulin analog (glulisine, lispro, and aspart) was assigned to eight pumps in a randomized order for each of nine runs of 5-day duration. Pumps were primed to receive a basal dose of 0.1 IU/h with a bolus dose of 2 IU given three times each day. Pumps were placed in an incubator to maintain temperature in the range of 32 to 36 degrees C.
Over the entire study period, there were 48 occlusions. Early occlusions (within 72 hours) occurred during five of the nine runs with no evidence of any difference between insulins (p = .27); there were no occlusions before 48 hours. Over the whole of the 5-day infusion period, the probabilities of overall occlusion for each insulin were 40.9% [28 to 55%, 95% confidence interval (CI)] for glulisine, 9.2% (4 to 19.5%, 95% CI) for aspart, and 15.7% (8.1 to 28.1%, 95% CI) for lispro. All occlusions, except for three, occurred during a bolus infusion.
During CSII under laboratory conditions, early catheter occlusions (within 72 hours) are rare and independent of the choice of insulin analog. For patients using insulin pump therapy, the importance of catheter change within 72 hours should be emphasized irrespective of the insulin used. Beyond 72 hours, the risk of occlusion differs between insulins, being more common with glulisine.

[Insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18438545/),"
Both Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) and Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) are effective ways of implementing intensive management of DM1 to attain near normal glycemic levels and a more flexible lifestyle. CSII is as safe as MDI and has some advantages over it mostly in diabetic patients with frequent hypoglycemias with important dawn phenomenum, gastroparesia, during pregnancy, in children and in patients with an erratic way of living. CSII allows a better chance to reach better glycemic control with less hypoglycemia, asymptomatic hypoglycemias and a better quality of life. Besides, risks are lower and adverse events are less frequent in DM1 patients under CSII as compared to MDI. To obtain results like this, a careful adjustment of basal and boluses insulin doses and an adequate patient follow-up are essential.

A survey of insulin-dependent diabetes-part I: therapies and devices.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18437199/),"
This paper surveys diabetes therapies from telemedicine viewpoint. In type 1 diabetes therapies, the exogenous insulin replacement is generally considered as a primary treatment. However, the complete replacement of exogenous insulin is still a challenging issue because of its complexity of modeling the dynamics, which is typically modeled nonlinearly. On the other hand, thanks to the progress of medical devices, currently the diabetes therapies are being automated. These medical devices include automated insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors. Insulin pumps are designed to create artificial insulin perfusion while they largely rely on the blood glucose profile measurements and these measurements are achieved by one or more blood glucose sensors. The blood glucose measurements are also important for the insulin-dependent diabetes therapies. An insulin pump along with sensors establishes a good feedback system providing the appropriate amount of the exogenous insulin on demand. Controlling the amount of exogenous insulin to suppress the blood glucose levels requires complicated computations. This paper mostly explains both type 1 and 2 diabetes and their mechanisms accompanied by descriptions of diabetes therapy and medical devices currently utilized in the therapy.

Unexplained hyperglycemia in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: evaluation and treatment.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375782/),"
The purpose of this review study was to determine and categorize common causes of intermittent hyperglycemia and suggest potential measures to prevent and treat the identified causes.
A literature review was conducted to obtain relevant information on hyperglycemia and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Medical departments from Novo/Nordisk, Eli Lilly and Company, and Sanofi/Aventis were contacted requesting information on their insulin temperature stability, the compatibility of insulin with insulin/pump reservoirs, and tubing sets/catheters. Endocrinologists, Certified Diabetes Educators, and pump manufacturing company trainers were interviewed for their clinical observations and to determine the incidence of reported hyperglycemia and relationships to pump failures.
Causes of intermittent hyperglycemia in CSII patients included problems with mechanical evaluation of the pump, basal/bolus review, reservoir/tubing, catheter site selection/placement, and insulin compatibility/stability.
As more patients and health care providers strive to improve control of diabetes, use of insulin pump therapy will continue to increase. Unexplained hyperglycemia will continue to occur, which can lead to increased health care costs due to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Evaluation of patient techniques and pump programming can uncover many potential causes, and the health care provider can assist in patient education to prevent further episodes.

Experiences of parents of young people with diabetes using insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18350856/),"
National guidance on the use of insulin pump therapy in the management of type 1 diabetes in adults (currently under review) also applies to children and adolescents. However, access to this treatment relies on the availability of health professionals trained in the use of pumps with children and young people rather than on clinical need.
To examine the experiences of parents of children and young people using insulin pump therapy treatment to treat their type 1 diabetes.
Parents of 44 children and young people aged one to 16 years identified from the databases of two support and advocacy groups responded to email or postal self-completion questionnaires.
Percentage frequency and thematic analysis identified issues relating to: access of information about pumps from NHS sources; high initial refusal rates by diabetes teams for children wanting to use the treatment; distance travelled to access a pump-trained team; reasons for starting the treatment; choice; benefits; information and assistance needs once using the treatment; and parents' involvement in deciding their child's diabetes care plan.
Generalisability is limited by the small scale of the study but these results suggest that in addition to improving glycaemic control, insulin pump therapy offers flexibility, choice and a better quality of life for children and their families.

""Double diabetes,"" which refers to the coexistence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, is a newly coined term in the diabetic literature. Excessive weight gain and a family history of type 2 diabetes in a patient with type 1 diabetes are the possible major causes. We report a case of double diabetes in a 45-year-old patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus that developed after insulin pump therapy. Insulin pump therapy is a valuable method used in the management of type 1 diabetes mellitus that may provide life comfort. However, this comfort may result in excessive weight gain, which, when combined with a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, may predispose to double diabetes. Clinicians must consider this pattern during the use of insulin pump therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes.

Long-acting insulin analogs versus insulin pump therapy for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18227475/),"
Insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII]) is now an established form of intensive insulin treatment. It is pertinent to ask, however, if multiple daily injection (MDI) regimens based on new long-acting insulin analogs such as glargine and detemir have now replaced the need for CSII. In type 1 diabetes, CSII reduces the frequency of severe hypoglycemia compared with isophane-based MDIs, but the rate of severe hypoglycemia is usually similar on glargine- or detemir-based MDIs compared with isophane-based MDIs. CSII reduces A1C and glycemic variability compared with isophane-based MDIs; but glargine and detemir do not improve A1C or variability in many patients, particularly those who are prone to hypoglycemia. Head-to-head comparisons of CSII with MDI based on glargine indicate lower A1C, fructosamine, or glucose levels on CSII. It can be concluded that long-acting insulin analogs have not yet replaced the need for insulin pump therapy in type 1 diabetes, and CSII is the best current therapeutic option for some type 1 diabetic subjects. In type 2 diabetes, CSII and MDI produce similar glycemic control, although there is little study of MDI based on long-acting analogs compared with pumps. It is possible that CSII will be beneficial in selected patient groups with type 2 diabetes, but this requires further study.

Will long acting insulin analogs influence the use of insulin pump therapy in type 1 diabetes?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18220579/),"
Insulin pump therapy enjoys a steadily growing number of users and is associated with an approximately 0.5% lower A1c as compared to flexible insulin injection therapy in type 1 diabetes patients. An important question is whether superiority of insulin pump therapy persists in the era of rapid acting analogs and will persist in the era of long acting analogs. Pooled data of three randomized clinical trials using rapid acting analogs in both arms shows a 0.35% lower A1c when on the pump. Treatment effect was shown to be larger in those with higher baseline A1c's. Results of three trials comparing insulin pump therapy with regimens consisting of both rapid acting and long acting analogs are inconsistent, probably indicating the advantage of pump therapy at group level is likely to have become relatively small. Therefore, the challenge for the treatment team is to identify those patients who benefit most from insulin pump treatment. Poor glycemic control merits a trial of insulin pump therapy in the motivated patient. Other indications for insulin pump therapy include the need for several basal rates, a life style characterized by unpredictable physical activity and patient preference.

To determine the safety and efficacy of U-500 regular insulin in pump therapy and to assess satisfaction with U-500 insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes and severe insulin resistance.
We performed a retrospective review of medical records of 6 patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance who had been using U-500 insulin pump therapy for at least 6 months. In addition, we conducted a telephone follow-up patient satisfaction survey.
The mean age of the patients was 57 +/- 6 years. Of the 6 patients (3 men and 3 women), 4 were white, 1 was black, and 1 was Asian. The mean hemoglobin A1c value before continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy with U-500 regular insulin was 9.1% +/- 1.8%, and the mean U-100 insulin dose required was 391 +/- 91 U/day. In comparison, the mean U-500 insulin dose required at 6 months was 59.2 +/- 13.6 U/day, which is equivalent to 296 +/- 68 U/day of U-100 insulin (P = 0.04), and the mean hemoglobin A1c value at 6 months after treatment with the insulin pump using U-500 regular insulin was 6.9% +/- 0.9% (P = 0.03). In addition, our study patients lost a mean of 6.1 lb during the 6-month period, and no patient had clinically significant episodes of hypoglycemia. The majority of the patients reported a higher satisfaction with the U-500 insulin pump therapy in comparison with conventional insulin treatment.
U-500 insulin pump therapy is a novel alternative for patients with type 2 diabetes and severe insulin resistance who have not met glycemic control goals with use of standard intensive insulin regimens.

The importance of carbohydrate counting in the treatment of children with diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17727386/),"
Carbohydrate (Carb) counting is a meal planning approach for patients with diabetes mellitus that focuses on carbohydrate as the primary nutrient affecting postprandial glycemic response. The concept of carb counting is not new. In the early 1990's the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) used carb counting as one of its education tools. More recently, short acting insulin analogues and insulin pumps have made the role of carb counting important and popular. Carb counting can be used in conjunction with a meal plan to set carbohydrate targets at each meal and snack. It is also used, perhaps more commonly, to estimate carbohydrate intake and adjust insulin around mixed meals and snacks using insulin to carbohydrate ratio. This effectively addresses the variable eating habits of most children and adolescents. The method may be adapted for patients who use a conventional insulin regimen and may meet the needs of patients who use multiple daily injections (MDI) or an insulin pump. Carb counting can make food planning flexible and enjoyable for patients, and the meal planning approach is very important for the physical growth and psychological development of children with diabetes. This paper describes the importance of carb counting for childhood diabetes as well as some of the special aspects associated with it.

to evaluate the combination of insulin pump therapy and continuous glucose monitoring in outcome on metabolic control in patients with brittle type 1 diabetes.
Insulin pump therapy was initiated in eleven brittle type 1 diabetics with poor metabolic control (mean Hba1c = 9.6%). Metabolic control was evaluated with CGMS and HbA1c in the following 6 months.
Glycated haemoglobin showed a reduction in 1.4% in the 6 months following initialisation of pump therapy. Physical activity, various foods and insulin were tested with CGMS. There were no severe hypoglycaemia and occasional postprandial hyperglycaemia, where patients and their family learned the practical issues of carbohydrate counting. During the next 6 months on pump therapy, the patients successfully managed their diabetes.
Insulin pump therapy can be initiated and used effectively in brittle type 1 diabetics to improve metabolic control and quality-of-life. When diabetes and pump management are appropriately individualized, this kind of therapy can help type 1 diabetics to achieve and to sustain metabolic control. Lifestyle flexibility, quality-of-life improvement, and independence can be maintained throughout young adulthood.

[The influence of long-term therapy with the insulin pump (CSII) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus on metabolic compensation and on the incidence of hypoglycaemia. Comparison with intensified conventional insulin therapy (MDI)].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17702123/),"
The principal objective of this paper is to verify, in clinical practice, the long-term affect (7 to 8 year follow up) and safety of insulin pump treatment in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients and to compare the results for diabetes compensation in patients treated with the insulin pump with a control group of patients treated with intensified insulin therapy using the MDI (multiple daily injection) method.
We followed up 35 patients treated with the insulin pump and 35 patients in the control group. We evaluated the monitored parameters for both patient groups at the beginning and at the end of the follow up period. With respect to glycated haemoglobin, we evaluated the results on a yearly basis, and also on year by year changes. We assessed the incidence of hypoglycaemia in both groups on a yearly basis. The following aspects were considered in order to determine the level of statistical significance of the different parameters: (1) we compared the initial state with that seen at the end of the follow up, (2) we analysed the year by year changes in glycated haemoglobin, (3) we compared the patients treated with the insulin pump with those in the control group. Diabetes compensation was evaluated on the basis of measurement of glycated haemoglobin and calculation of glycaemia. Comparison of the incidence of hypoglycaemia was done for all hypoglycemic events and then separately for severe hypoglycaemia. Also evaluated were changes in weight and in insulin dose in 24 hours.
The group of patients treated with the insulin pump recorded a dramatic decrease in glycated haemoglobin in the course of the follow up, p < 0.001, and also in average glycaemia, p < 0.001. In the control group only a transitory significant decrease of HbA1c, p < 0.05, was recorded in the first and second year of follow up, later the result was insignificant, i.e. p > 0.05, as compared with the initial state. In this group of patients, no significant improvement in average glycaemia, p > 0.05, was recorded when compared with the initial state. Comparison ofthe two groups of patients showed that HbA(1c), p < 0.001, and average glycaemia, p < 0.001, were worse with statistical significance in patients treated with the insulin pump at the beginning of the follow up. At the end of the follow up period, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms ofglycated haemoglobin, p > 0.05, but a statistically significant difference was recorded in average glycaemia, p < 0.001, in favour of the group of patients treated with the insulin pump. The use of the insulin pump resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic events as compared with the control group, p = 0.010. This decrease was reflected in the measured parameters from the third year of the study to the end of follow up. However, at the beginning of the study and in the first and second years of follow up there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes, p > 0.05. No statistically significant difference between the two groups was recorded in the incidence of all hypoglycaemic episodes from the beginning of the follow up to its end, p > 0.05. In both groups of patients, a statistically significant gain in weight was seen from the beginning of the study to the end of the follow up period, however, its statistical significance was lower (p < 0.05) in the group of patients treated with insulin pump than in the control group (p < 0.001). We proved a statistically significant decrease in daily insulin dose (p < 0.001 )was required in the group of patients treated with insulin pump, whilst no statistically significant change in the dose was recorded in the control group (p > 0.05).
In the course of the follow up, we proved that treatment with the insulin pump in type 1 diabetes is more beneficial to patients than MDI treatment. This was reflected by both better compensation of diabetes and a lower incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes.

The DIABTel system, a Web-based telemedicine application, integrates a whole communication system (glucometer, insulin pump, wireless hand-held assistant) for medical remote advice. We sought to evaluate, in terms of glycemic control, the DIABTel system in a randomized crossover clinical study.
Ten patients with type 1 diabetes [5 women, age 40.6 (21-62) years, diabetes duration 14.7 (3-52) years] were included. During the 4-week active phase, data sent by patients were analyzed by the physician and modifications of the basal rate and bolus were advised in the following 24 hours. During the control phase, patients sent glucose data without any feedback from the medical center.
The mean numbers of daily glucose values and bolus sent by patients during the active period were 4.46 +/- 0.91 and 4.58 +/- 0.89, respectively. The personal digital assistant functionalities used more frequently by patients were (times per week) data visualization (8.1 +/- 6.8), data download from the insulin pump (6.8 +/- 3.3), and synchronization with the telemedicine server (8.5 +/- 4.9). After the experimental phase, serum fructosamine decreased significantly (393 +/- 32 vs 366 +/- 25 micromol/liter; p < 0.05) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) tended to decrease (8.0 +/- 0.6 vs 7.78 +/- 0.6; p = 0.073), whereas no changes were observed during the control phase. The number of treatment modifications proposed and performed by the patients correlated with the change observed in HbA1c during the active phase (r = -0.729, p = 0.017).
The DIABTel system, a telemedicine system that includes a wireless personal assistant for remote treatment advising, allows better glycemic control in pump-treated patients with type 1 diabetes.

This was a 15-week treat-to-target pilot study of 16 adult subjects (n = 50% male, age 45.9 +/- 16 years) with type 1 diabetes (duration of diabetes 21.9 +/- 11 years) on MDI therapy with hemoglobin A1c levels at or above 7.5% at baseline. Subjects were randomized to either the study arm (using a combined insulin pump and real-time continuous glucose monitoring system) or the control arm [which continued on MDI therapy with self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) only]. All subjects dosed insulin according to results of SMBG by finger stick and uploaded data into the CareLink data management software.
Significant improvements in glycemic control were observed from baseline in both study groups-study arm: pre-A1c 9.45 +/- 0.55 and post-A1c 7.4 +/- 0.66 (p = 0.00037); control arm: pre-A1c 8.58 +/- 1.30 and post-A1c 7.5 +/-1.01 (p = 0.04). Both arms had no incidence of severe hypoglycemia.
In this pilot study, the Paradigm REAL-Time System was initiated safely and effectively in type 1 diabetes patients who were pump naïve using a stepwise educational protocol.

Changes in glycaemic control are related to the systolic function in type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17454832/),"
To examine whether changes in glycaemic control are related to the left ventricular function, in a group of type 1 diabetic patients.
We included 19 consecutive type 1 diabetic patients selected for insulin pump therapy due to poor metabolic control. The outcome measures were HbA1c and systolic left ventricular strain rate as measured by Tissue Doppler echocardiography. Mean follow-up period was 45 days (range 35-50). All patients included had an ejection fraction>55%. None had cardiac symptoms.
The mean age of the participants was 40 years (range 22-65). Following initiation of insulin-pump therapy, the mean HbA1c improved significantly from 8.6+/-1.4% to 7.6+/-1.1% (p<0.01). The mean strain rate of 16 myocardial segments also improved significantly, from -1.58+/-0.30 s-1 to -1.80+/-0.4 s-1 (p<0.01). In addition, there was a significant correlation between the changes in left ventricular function and the changes in HbA1c (delta-Strain rate vs. delta-HbA1c: r=0.49, p<0.01).
Changes in glycaemic control resulting from insulin pump therapy seem significantly related to the systolic function of the left ventricle.

"New technology, new errors: how to prime an upgrade of an insulin infusion pump.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17425237/),"
A series of use errors occurred when switching an ambulatory care clinic patient from an older model to a newer model of an ambulatory continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump.
The nurse practitioner (N.P.) reviewed the new pump's mechanics with the patient, who had a 26-year history of Type 1 diabetes mellitus, and supervised the patient's programming of the pump. At bedtime, a blood sugar of > 250 mg/dL prompted the patient to give herself insulin via the pump. The next morning, she was treated at the emergency department for diabetic ketoacidosis.
The pump had been improperly primed, resulting in no insulin delivery. The incident also reflected the absence of a fail-safe mechanism(s) on the pump to alert the user to the improper priming and inappropriate handoff of the patient's care. Unlike the old pump, the new pump did not require manual priming. The lack of delivery of insulin resulted in DKA, a potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes. A root cause analysis suggested several important safety issues, including skipping of steps on the patient training checklist and other shortcuts in patient training.
The clinic developed policies and procedures, including mandatory formal training for each pump model by the certified pump trainer and for initiation of insulin pump therapy. This case illustrates the importance of a structured device selection process, provider education, patient education, and monitoring for safety and effectiveness of technological devices in care.

Perceptions of psychosocial factors and the insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17327319/),"
The purpose of this study was to identify psychosocial issues related to diabetes, approaches to self-care, self-perceptions, and social interactions among insulin pump users with type 1 diabetes.
Adult insulin pump users participated in focus groups loosely formed on the basis of A1C level. Transcripts of focus group meetings were coded into themes by five reviewers using NVivo2 qualitative software.
Thirty adults with long-term diabetes participated in five focus groups: two with low mean +/-SD A1C (6.8 +/- 0.4%), one with mid A1C (7.80 +/- 0.3%), and two with high A1C (9.1 +/- 0.5%). Three major themes were identified: impact on diabetes self-care, emotional reactions to the insulin pump, body image, and social acceptance. Participants who described the pump as a tool to meet glycemic goals also described a more active approach to diabetes and had better glycemic control; those who discussed the pump as a panacea described more passive self-care and had poorer glycemic control. Low A1C groups reported that starting the insulin pump reminded them of feelings they experienced at their initial diabetes diagnosis, whereas the high A1C groups did not report these feelings. Women were more concerned than men about body image and social acceptance with pump use.
Active participation in self-care, realistic expectations of pump use, and emotional recall of diabetes diagnosis were associated with better glycemic control. Interventions to improve diabetes management with pump use should include evaluation and discussion of active versus passive approaches to self-care, recall of diabetes diagnosis, expectations of the pump, and pump-related self-consciousness and body image concerns. The roles of these factors in optimal diabetes management warrant further investigation.

In vitro stability of insulin aspart in simulated continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using a MiniMed 508 insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17316101/),"
This study was designed to assess the stability and potency of insulin aspart under experimental circumstances simulating worst-case conditions during clinical use for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
The potency and stability of two batches of U100 insulin aspart, one recently manufactured and one nearing the end of shelf life, were evaluated after storage in a Medtronic (Northridge, CA) MiniMed 508 pump for up to 7 days at 37 +/- 2 degrees C. The pumps were placed on a vibrating platform (30 +/- 3 oscillations/min, 2 +/- 0.5 cm amplitude displacement) for 24 h/day to simulate movement by the pump user. The product remaining in the pump reservoir was tested at days 3, 4, and 7 and compared with control samples.
After 7 days of in-pump use, there was no significant reduction in potency of insulin aspart or difference from reference values with regards to pH, isoAsp(B28), desamido insulin aspart, insulin aspart-related impurities, or high-molecular-weight proteins. The concentration of phenol and m-cresol remained at levels sufficient to ensure preservative efficacy for both control and test samples. There was no evidence of fibrillation or precipitation.
The data indicate that storage in the plastic pump reservoir under temperature and vibration conditions simulating worst-case conditions during clinical use for CSII did not affect the stability or potency of insulin aspart significantly, and support an in-pump-use time of 7 days in the MiniMed 508 pump.

Clinical experience with an integrated continuous glucose sensor/insulin pump platform: a feasibility study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17142207/),"
The recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of an integrated real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system and insulin pump (Medtronic Mini-Med Paradigm REAL-Time System; Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, Calif) is the most recent breakthrough paving the way toward the development of a closedloop insulin delivery system that could revolutionize diabetes care. An early prototype of the MiniMed Paradigm REAL-Time System--which provided both realtime CGM and insulin pump therapy but was not yet fully integrated--was tested in 20 volunteer subjects with type 1 diabetes who wore the device for up to 2 y. Subjects were instructed on the technical use of the device but were provided no additional support, aside from their usual diabetes care. Participation in the trial averaged 317 d (minimum, 88 d; maximum, 618 d). Five participants prematurely dropped out of the study (2 because of the inconvenience of carrying 2 devices). Data from all subjects were analyzed. Subjects reduced their A1C by a mean of 1.1% (standard deviation, 0.8). After 3 mo of device use, the number of participants who achieved A1C <7% increased by more than 3-fold. Individuals with baseline A1C >or= 7% had a 67% likelihood of achieving an A1C <7% by the first follow-up assessment. This observational study of combined CGM and insulin pump therapy suggests that this innovative device can help people achieve improved glycemic control. Given that only about one third of individuals with diabetes are achieving glycemic control targets, more effective methods to help patients avoid the devastating consequences of uncontrolled diabetes are desperately needed.

Diabetes mellitus is the most common metabolic disorder in childhood. Today, children with diabetes are receiving new technologically advanced treatment options, such as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. School nurses are the primary health caregivers of children with diabetes during school hours. Therefore, it is important to determine their perceptions, resources, and resource needs when caring for students with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or insulin pump therapy. This study uses a phenomenological approach to examine the experiences of school nurses caring for students receiving insulin pump therapy. Eleven school nurses were interviewed using semistructured taped interviews. The nurses' responses indicated that they were ""scared"" when first caring for students with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. However, they were able to work through their fear by using their resources and gaining more knowledge and hands-on experience with insulin pumps. The data also revealed that school nurses who were able to learn the language of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy and successfully deal with pump problems developed trusting and knowing relationships with students, teachers, and parents.

To examine longitudinal outcomes, rate of and reasons for discontinuation, and predictors of insulin pump success in a cohort of youth initiating pump therapy.
We followed a cohort of youth with type 1 diabetes (n = 161) starting the pump between 1998 and 2001 and recorded natural history of treatment.
At pump start, patients (71% female) had a mean age of 14.1 +/- 3.7 years, diabetes duration of 7.1 +/- 4.0 years, daily blood glucose monitoring (BGM) frequency of 4.0 +/- 1.2, a daily insulin dose of 1.0 +/- 0.3 units/kg, and an HbA(1c) (A1C) of 8.4 +/- 1.4%. After 1 year, mean daily BGM frequency was 4.5 +/- 1.7, daily insulin dose was 0.8 +/- 0.2 units/kg, and A1C was 8.1 +/- 1.3% (all baseline versus 1-year data, P < 0.01). As of 2005, 29 patients (18%) had resumed injection therapy at a mean age of 17.0 +/- 2.9 years after a mean duration of pump use of 2.1 +/- 1.3 years. BGM frequency at baseline and at 1 year was significantly lower in the patients who resumed injection therapy (P < 0.02). In addition, patients who remained on the pump had lower A1C than those who resumed injection therapy at both 1 year (P = 0.04) and at the most recent clinic visit (P = 0.01).
After an average of 3.8 years, >80% of pediatric patients maintained pump therapy with preservation of baseline A1C. Patients discontinuing the pump were less adherent and did not achieve equivalent glycemic benefit compared with continued users; these patients require ongoing support aimed at improving adherence and outcomes.

Treatment with CSII in two infants with neonatal diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17054451/),"
This article reports the case studies of two children with neonatal onset of diabetes who were treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) from within 4 d to 3 wk of the diagnosis. The aim was to describe diabetes-related and insulin-pump-specific data in relation to growth and various feeding patterns when using CSII in infants with diabetes during their first year of life. The two children's medical records were scrutinized. The results showed that both children had good metabolic control [median hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 5.3 and 5.7%, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, reference: 3.4-5.0%. Compared with the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) HbA1c units, Swedish units give approximately 1% point lower results]. No episodes of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis have been demonstrated. The children had normal growth patterns, as they followed a normal feeding regime for their age. The meal doses of insulin were given over 12 min to 3 h. The children had diluted Humalog((R)) insulin 10 U/mL (Eli Lilly & Co, Indianapolis, IN, USA) in their pumps. Different types of insulin pumps were used, namely, the Minimed 507C and 508 (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and a Disetronic H-tron V100 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). The children used different types of infusion sets. Neither family reported any technical problems with their pump system. CSII was an effective and safe treatment for the two children suffering from neonatal diabetes. This offers an alternative for other infants with a similar diagnosis.

Insulin pump therapy is a diabetes management tool that can significantly aid in achieving treatment goals in children, adolescents and adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus. These goals include optimal glycaemic control, lifestyle flexibility, quality-of-life improvement, and independence. Successful implementation of CSII requires a motivated, conscientious patient with a range of technical skills and self-management capabilities. Patients develop this knowledge through the program of education provided by a healthcare team including diabetologists, diabetes educator, dietietian, pump manufacturer representative, and in some cases, mental health professionals. Training of the patient to use a pump includes three basic steps: 1 - pre-pump education, 2 - pump start-up, 3 - evaluation, independence assessment and re-education. It is a relatively long process that can range from a few weeks to several months. Insulin pump therapy checklist, included in this paper, is a useful tool in planning and providing education for insulin pump users.

Position statement: Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in very young children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17015512/),"
Insulin pump therapy has become increasingly popular for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in pediatric patients. Although significant experience has accrued with the use of this modality in older children and adolescents, much less data are available regarding continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in the very young. Policies of individual physician practices and insurance companies vary widely, and there is currently no consensus regarding the appropriateness of insulin pump therapy in the under 6 age group. However, we have witnessed in recent years a significant increase in the number of clinical trials investigating the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in young patients, and reports of > 100 preschool-aged diabetic children treated with insulin pumps are available in the literature. Although these studies have been of relatively short duration (< or = 12 months), the results are remarkably consistent. Although there is no evidence that insulin pump therapy results in a sustained improvement in glycemic control in this age group, risks associated with these devices in the hands of reliable adults who are managing diabetes in very young children are low. Parental satisfaction related to the increased flexibility that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion affords anecdotally seems to be high, although formal examination of parental stress and health-related quality of life in this setting has been minimal. Important questions remain regarding selection of appropriate candidates for insulin pump therapy, whether benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion outweigh the costs, and what eventual outcomes will be in children treated with pumps from a very young age. Long-term follow-up of medical, psychological, and neurocognitive parameters in these young patients will be paramount. Our goal with this review is to summarize efficacy and safety of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in children < or = 6 years of age, present potential pros and cons of using insulin pumps in this population, and propose clinical management guidelines that could be useful for both practitioners and third-party payers alike.

To demonstrate the benefits and to advocate the safety and efficacy of using an insulin pump with U-500 insulin in comparison with U-100 insulin for a pregnant patient with diabetes requiring massive doses of insulin.
We present a detailed case report about the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with U-500 insulin during pregnancy. Dose calculation is reviewed, and the benefits of insulin pump therapy in patients with diabetes are discussed.
A 34-year-old white woman, with a history of type 2 diabetes for 7 years, was seen at 17 weeks of gestation because of episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia accompanied by a very high insulin requirement. At the time of initial assessment, the patient was hospitalized with diabetic ketoacidosis and was being treated with 400 U/day of intravenously administered insulin. She responded well to intravenous therapy, but when switched to a regimen of NPH and regular insulin, she continued to have high blood glucose levels (despite 4 to 5 insulin injections a day, with a total daily dose up to 400 to 450 U). Use of an insulin pump was instituted, which presented another challenge because of the limited reservoir capacity and the need to change sites at least once or twice a day. We decided to initiate U-500 insulin therapy with a total basal rate of 40 U/day. Her meal carbohydrate insulin ratio and correction bolus were calculated on a U-100 scale. Then each estimated dose for meal coverage, depending on her carbohydrate intake, as well as the appropriate corrections were totaled and divided by 5 to convert to U-500. Throughout the rest of her pregnancy, the patient was able to maintain tight glycemic control, with no further hospitalizations for stabilization of hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia.
To our knowledge, this is the first report of successful management of difficult to control diabetes by means of an insulin pump with use of U-500 insulin in a pregnant patient who required massive doses of insulin.

Ketoacidosis is one of the most severe complications of Type 1 diabetes. Development of ketosis leads to substantial shifts in electrolyte and ion concentrations in the different fluid compartments of the body. This study was performed to investigate the performance of the continuous glucose monitoring device (CGMS) during ketoacidosis.
Twelve patients with Type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) participated in this trial [10 women, two men; age (mean +/- sd) 34 +/- 9 years; disease duration 17 +/- 10 years; HbA(1c) 7.1 +/- 1.0%]. In the morning, patients ate breakfast and the insulin pump was stopped at 11.00 h and restarted after 8 h. Observation parameters during this experiment were: blood glucose (laboratory reference and CGMS), 3-hydroxy-butyrate (3-OHB), pH, Na, pCO(2), pO(2), free fatty acids, osmolarity, standard bicarbonate, and lactate.
Blood glucose increased and reached a plateau within 2 h after pump stop (from 6.2 +/- 2.56 to 16.7 +/- 4.44 mmol/l, P < 0.001). A constant increase in 3-OHB (from 0.0 to 0.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/l, P < 0.001) and decrease in pH (from 7.43 +/- 0.02 to 7.40 +/- 0.03, P < 0.05) indicated ketosis development. Na decreased from 141 +/- 1.4 to 138 +/- 2.8 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Free fatty acids increased from 0.577 +/- 0.330 to 1.330 +/- 0.462 mmol/l (P < 0.001). The CGMS values showed excellent agreement with the capillary blood laboratory method during the entire experiment, and a modified error grid analysis revealed that 99.5% of the values were in the clinically acceptable zones A and B.
The CGMS device was confirmed to be reliable and accurate during the development of hyperglycaemia and ketotic conditions.

To review the current experience with insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents in order to guide pediatricians regarding indications and complications.
Systematic review of articles published in the literature referring to the use of insulin pump therapy, indications, complications and response to treatment. All articles published between 1995 and 2005 and appearing in the MEDLINE and LILACS databases were reviewed. The keywords were: insulin pump, type 1 diabetes mellitus and diabetes mellitus. The articles covering the subject of interest and referring to children and adolescents were selected.
Insulin pump therapy is not required for all patients with type 1 diabetes, since intensive treatments produce very similar results in terms of glycated hemoglobin and control of complications over the medium and long terms. However, the pump allows for greater comfort for patients, with less rigid meal schedules and better quality of life. The first requirement for patients intending to use the pump is getting used to having a device attached to the body and following strict glucose control; otherwise, pump therapy is not advantageous. Complications are rare due to the technologies currently available. The cost, however, is greater than with conventional treatments.
The development of infusion pumps and glucose monitors, including continuous monitoring systems, will lead to ""intelligent pumps,"" so that a true ""artificial pancreas"" will be available, which can even be implanted in the patient, allowing non-diabetic persons to lead a normal life.

To determine the safety and effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in attaining long-term glycaemic control in paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes and to compare the results with those previously recorded in the same patients taking multiple daily injections (MDI) (four injections a day).
Forty-two patients (mean age 12.2 +/- 3.4 years; range 4.5-17 years; 24 males; mean duration of Type 1 diabetes 5.1 +/- 3.0 years) were studied. The following parameters were assessed in the year before starting CSII treatment (during MDI treatment) and during the 4 years of insulin pump treatment: annual mean HbA1c, insulin requirements (U/kg per day), annual mean of body mass index (BMI) z scores, and adverse events (severe hypoglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis/patient per year). Two patients discontinued pump therapy (after 1-year and 2-year follow-up, respectively) because of non-compliance with CSII therapy.
Compared with the annual mean HbA1c observed prior to CSII therapy (8.9 +/- 1.0%), the mean HbA1c levels were lower during the first (8.2 +/- 0.9%; P = 0.00), second (8.6 +/- 1.0%; P = 0.05), third (8.4 +/- 0.9%; P = 0.01) and fourth (8.2 +/- 1%; P = 0.00) year of CSII therapy. The insulin requirements (U/kg per day) decreased during CSII treatment compared with MDI treatment. Compared with the annual mean of BMI z scores prior to CSII therapy, BMI z scores were significantly lower during the third and fourth years of CSII therapy. Through the first, second, third and fourth years of follow-up the number of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (20.0, 20.0, 20.0 and 0 episodes/1000 patient-years, respectively) and diabetic ketoacidosis (0.05, 0.00, 0.03 and 0.00 episodes/patient per year, respectively), events were similar to that in the year preceding CSII therapy (20.0 and 0.03, respectively).
In this population of selected patients in our clinic, CSII appears to be a safe and effective therapeutic alternative to MDI treatment. This therapy may ensure a stable improvement in long-term glycaemic control in paediatric patients, with no increase in diabetic ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemic events and, on the other hand, with a trend of reduction in BMI z scores.

Predictors of fear of hypoglycemia in adolescents with type 1 diabetes and their parents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16911009/),"
This study tested the hypothesis that both trait anxiety and hypoglycemic history contribute to fear of hypoglycemia (FOH) both in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and in their parents, and relationships between FOH and other variables including metabolic control, symptom perception, and use of insulin pump therapy.
Thirty-nine parent-adolescent pairs completed questionnaires assessing background and clinical information, hypoglycemic episodes, FOH, and trait anxiety. Adolescent blood was also sampled for glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) measurement.
In adolescents, both trait anxiety and frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes were significant predictors of FOH, together accounting for almost 50% of the variance. Parental FOH was not predicted by their own trait anxiety or their child's hypoglycemic history but by whether they believed that their child carried emergency glucose. FOH was not related to metabolic control, although adolescents who experienced recent severe hypoglycemia (SH) with unconsciousness had significantly higher HbA1c. Parental trait anxiety significantly correlated with child trait anxiety, but parent-child levels of FOH were unrelated. Neither trait anxiety nor FOH related to reported symptoms, and FOH was not lower in parents with insulin pump therapy.
Consistent with findings from adult patient populations, trait anxiety levels and recent experiences with hypoglycemia predict FOH in adolescents with T1DM. In parents, however, beliefs about their adolescents' ability to cope with hypoglycemic episodes predicted FOH. FOH in adolescents with T1DM and their parents is a complex construct influenced by multiple personality and situational and behavioral factors, and its impact on diabetes management remains unclear.

Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk for neonatal morbidity and mortality. One of the most important goals in treating pregnancies complicated with diabetes is keeping glucose level within the normal range, especially in the first trimester. A portable insulin pump for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) represents the best form of therapy for patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of therapy with a portable insulin pump for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion during the first trimester of pregnancy on the quality of glycoregulation and pregnancy outcome in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
A total of 17 newly diagnosed pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were treated with CSII therapy for three months. The parameters of glycoregulation (hemoglobin A, glycosylated--HbAlc, mean blood glucose value in daily profiles--MBG, daily requirement for insulin--IJ/kg BM), lipid levels, blood preassure and renal function were estimated before and after the therapy. These parameters were correlated with parameters of pregnancy outcome: fetal weight, APGAR score, duration of pregnancy.
There was a significant improvement in HbA1c (8.94 +/- 1.62 vs. 6.90 +/- 1.22 %,p < 0.05), MBG (9.23 +/- 2.22 vs. 6.41 +/- 1.72 mmol/l, p < 0.01), and daily requirement for insulin (0.66 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.13 IJ/kg BM, p < 0.05) during the CSII therapy. There were significant correlations between fetal weight and HbAlc (r = -0.60, p < 0.05), triglyceride levels (r = -0.63, p < 0.01), and the number of pregnancies (r = -0.62, p < 0.01), as well as between APGAR score and MBG (r = -0.52, p < 0.05) and cholesterol levels (r = -0.65, p < 0,01) before a portable insulin pump was applicated.

American Diabetes Association Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, selected research articles, textbooks, and Internet sources.
American Diabetes Association, American Association of Diabetes Educators, and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist acknowledge that no long-term studies have been conducted in older adults with DM. Furthermore, these groups as well as the American Geriatric Society conclude that a person's functional capacity and not age should determine the treatment modality most beneficial in each situation.
Management of diabetes in the older adult is a common clinical scenario for primary care providers (PCPs). Treatment strategies follow a continuum over time from lifestyle modification to intensive management. Intensive insulin therapy, through the use of either multiple daily injections or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using insulin pumps, has demonstrated benefit in both DM1 and DM2; however, there is evidence that PCPs are reluctant to initiate insulin. Moreover, in the management of older adults with diabetes, evidence-based outcomes regarding intensive management are lacking. Further studies are needed.

Implantable insulin pump therapy: an unusual presentation of a catheter-related complication.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16800761/),"
We report the case of a 63-year-old man who has a 19-year history of involvement in the implantable insulin pump program at Johns Hopkins University. After his most recent pump implantation in February 2004, his 24-h insulin requirement gradually increased from a baseline of 75 units to a peak of almost 500 units in June 2005. Surprisingly, insulin delivery from the pump and glycemic control remained satisfactory despite the dramatic change in insulin requirement. Laparotomy revealed a fibrous mass in the peritoneal cavity, with the track of the catheter extending into the mass. Insulin requirement declined post-resection of the mass and relocation of the catheter tip.

Technical risks with subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16799407/),"
The popularity of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), as a way for achieving long term strict glycaemic control in diabetic patients, has increased over the last ten years. Most reports on technical faults, often leading to metabolic emergencies, mainly ketoacidosis, have been published in the 1980s. Obstruction of infusion set and infection of infusion site are the most frequent events. Insulin precipitation or aggregation is thought to be one of the precipitating factors. Few data are available about failures of the pump itself. We report our experience of pump malfunctions recorded between 2001 and 2004 in 376 pumps used by patients treated with CSII therapy in Brittany. Recent studies indicate a decrease of metabolic complication frequency during CSII. This suggests technical improvements and/or a greater experience of physicians in selecting and educating patients. We report instructions for monitoring insulin pump therapy that should be included in a formal educational program for pump users. Clinical studies using newly available devices should reassess technical risks associated with CSII.

Hypoglycemia and ketoacidosis with insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16774616/),"
This review deals with the two most serious side effects encountered with insulin pump therapy, severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Although clinical follow-up studies reported decreased rates of severe hypoglycemia, randomized studies have not confirmed this, showing no difference between the pump and injection groups. Less-severe hypoglycemia (mild/moderate/symptomatic hypoglycemia) was found to be more common with pump use. Some patients have inadvertently dosed or overdosed while awake or during sleep, causing fatal outcome in rare cases. Population-based or retrospective clinical studies reported a low rate of DKA in pump users that was still a higher rate than those using injection therapy, at least in some countries. In research settings and for patients with good compliance and adequate family support, the risk of DKA seems lower; many short-term studies report no DKA at all, possibly due to the increased attention given to participants. The use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) seems to decrease the risk in patients who had recurrent DKA before pump start. Most episodes of DKA occur early after pump start, suggesting a learning curve occurs in all new forms of treatment. Increased teaching and awareness programs are vital to prevent severe hypoglycemia and DKA in children and adolescents using insulin pumps.

Risk and benefits of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment in school children and adolescents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16774614/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy with technically advanced modern insulin pumps is a treatment option enabling patients and multidisciplinary diabetes teams to achieve all current goals for the treatment of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM): near-normoglycemia, low rate of hypoglycemia, preventing or delaying long-term complications and increasing quality of life. Clinical studies demonstrate that CSII therapy reduces glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) with a concomitant decrease in the rate of hypoglycemic events, without excessive weight gain and with an increase of patients' treatment satisfaction in all pediatric age groups. With the development of continuous glucose sensing coupled with an insulin pump, patients can hope for an ever-increasing technological support for the management of insulin therapy in the foreseeable future.

Insulin pump therapy has, within the last 10 years, emerged as an increasingly popular modality of treatment to achieve intensive glycemic targets in type 1 diabetes (T1D). The evidence for the benefits of pump therapy has been demonstrated in adults and adolescents; however, until recently there has been a paucity of studies examining the efficacy and safety in pump therapy in very young children. The purpose of this article is to discuss the rationale for insulin pump therapy in infants and toddlers, review the available studies of pump therapy in this population, and show that the data support the use of insulin pumps in our very youngest of patients.

Although insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment was first introduced more than 25 yr ago, very few children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) utilized this therapy until recently. In this paper, we review many of the early triumphs, as well as a number of unexpected obstacles that were encountered in applying CSII in the treatment of T1DM. Nevertheless, the greater urgency to obtain optimal control of diabetes following the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), the introduction of rapid-acting insulin analogs and improvements in pump technology have led to a sharp increase in the use of this therapy in youth with T1DM and, generally, favorable outcomes. Moreover, the recent introduction of continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMSs) offers the prospect of finally realizing the full potential of insulin pump therapy to normalize hemoglobin A1c (HbAlc) levels with minimal risk of hypoglycemia.

Feasibility and safety of insulin pump therapy in children aged 2 to 7 years with type 1 diabetes: a retrospective study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16740857/),"
Although insulin pump therapy has been successful in adults, adolescents and school children, its use has been limited in young children. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the glycemic control, safety and efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion via pump in young children (2-7 years old) with type 1 diabetes who were transitioned from twice-a-day insulin injection (neutral protamine Hagedorn/Lente + Humalog/Novalog) to insulin pump therapy. Hemoglobin A1c, BMI, average fasting blood glucose, episodes of severe hypoglycemia, episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis, episodes of lipohypertrophy, blood glucose variability, and number of sick day calls were compared before and after insulin pump therapy.
Data were collected retrospectively by chart review over a 2-year period during quarterly diabetes clinic visits from 33 patients who were managed on neutral protamine Hagedorn/Lente + Humalog/Novolog twice-a-day injections for at least 1 year prior to transitioning to insulin pump therapy.
There was a significant improvement in the average hemoglobin A1c after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy. The average fasting blood sugar was lower in the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion group. Severe episodes of hypoglycemia and episodes of lipohypertrophy were significantly higher before insulin pump therapy initiation. There were significantly fewer sick day calls after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Blood sugar variability improved significantly after insulin pump therapy. There was no significant difference in BMI or amount of carbohydrate consumed. None of the patients experienced diabetic ketoacidosis requiring emergency treatment before or after insulin pump therapy.
Continous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy in young children with type 1 diabetes is a safe, effective and superior alternative to a twice-a-day insulin regimen.

To compare by age and glycemic control continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with multiple daily injections in youth with type 1 diabetes.
The files of 279 patients who had type 1 diabetes and switched from multiple daily injections to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion between 1998 and 2003 were reviewed for glycemic control, body mass index standard deviation score, and adverse events. Patients were divided by age as follows: 23 prepubertal (median age: 5.4; range: 1.6-8.6 years), 127 adolescent (median age: 13.7; range 9-17 years), and 129 young adult (median age: 22.8; range: 17-40 years). The data were compared between the 12 months of multiple daily injections that preceded continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion and the period after the start of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the whole cohort and by age group.
A significant decrease in hemoglobin A1c was demonstrated after the start of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion use for the entire cohort (-0.51%) and for the prepubertal (-0.48%), adolescent (-0.26%), and young adult (-0.76%) groups. There was a significant interaction between the change in hemoglobin A1c level and hemoglobin A1c value at initiation of pump therapy (-1.7% for patients with hemoglobin A1c > or = 10%; 0.2% for patients with hemoglobin A1c < or = 7%). The rate of severe hypoglycemic episodes decreased significantly in the adolescent group, from 36.5 to 11.1 events per 100 patient-years, and in the young adult group, from 58.1 to 23.3. There was no significant change in the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis between the 2 periods. The young adults showed a significant decrease in body mass index standard deviation scores (-0.08 +/- 0.37).
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion improves glycemic control in youth with type 1 diabetes, especially in those with a history of poor glycemic control. This improvement is associated with a decrease in the rate of severe hypoglycemia in the absence of weight gain.

[Guidelines concerning insulin dosage in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16704861/),"
The treatment of diabetes mellitus with a continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has become very popular and is well accepted by diabetic patients. Pump therapy mimics the physiological insulin secretion and has been shown to be a safe and effective method of insulin administration alternative to the method of multiple injections. Continuous insulin infusion provides greater flexibility in the timing of meals and snacks with higher treatment satisfaction. Programmed basal rates improve nocturnal glycemic control and help to minimize a pre-breakfast increase of blood glucose level (the dawn phenomenon). Moreover, CSII can reduce exercise-induced and nocturnal hypoglycemia. Insulin pump therapy is effective in lowering glycated hemoglobin levels without higher risk of severe hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis. To achieve a proper metabolic control with this method of treatment, the patient and his family requires appropriate education including knowledge of diet management, insulin therapy and manual competence of pump device. Here we present general guidelines for patients education concerning insulin dosage, programming of basal insulin rates and meal boluses based on carbohydrates and protein-fat exchanges.

The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of meal bolus alarms would result in fewer missed meal boluses per week in youth with type 1 diabetes using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy.
This was a randomized trial of 48 youth using CSII, who were in suboptimal glycemic control with HbA(1c) (A1C) values > or =8.0%. Twenty-four subjects were randomized to use a Deltec Cozmo insulin pump with meal bolus alarms (experimental group), while the other 24 subjects continued use of their current insulin pumps (control group) without meal bolus alarms.
After 3 months of study, the number of missed meal boluses per week was significantly lower in the experimental group (from 4.9 +/- 3.7 to 2.5 +/- 2.5; P = 0.0005) but not significantly lower in the control group (from 4.3 +/- 2.7 to 4.2 +/- 3.9; P = 0.7610). Also after 3 months, the mean A1C value of the experimental group declined significantly (from 9.32 +/- 1.12 to 8.86 +/- 1.10; P = 0.0430). No significant decline in A1C was present for the control group (from 8.93 +/- 1.04 to 8.67 +/- 1.17; P = 0.1940). After 6 months of study, the significant decline in A1C from baseline in the experimental group was no longer present. Pooling of all available data from the control and experimental groups showed that at baseline and 3 and 6 months, the number of missed meal boluses per week was significantly correlated with A1C values.
While meal bolus alarms may have the potential to improve suboptimal glycemic control in youth using CSII, our results demonstrated that these alarms had only a transient, modest effect in doing so.

Long-term intervention studies using insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16627387/),"
To discuss data from long-term intervention studies regarding therapy in type 1 diabetes and review strategies for preventing hypoglycemia and safely achieving glycemic goals in this patient population.
The shortcomings of traditional models of insulin therapy are elucidated, and the need for physiologic insulin replacement is emphasized.
An estimated more than 10 million patients will have type 1 diabetes worldwide within the next 20 years. Twice-daily injection of premixed or self-mixed insulin is the most common insulin regimen; however, this therapeutic strategy is also a major contributor to hypoglycemia and, eventually, hypoglycemia unawareness. Hypoglycemia unawareness in patients with type 1 diabetes has been found to be largely reversible. Moreover, intensive insulin therapy may prevent hypoglycemia and maintain glycemic targets. The most physiologic regimen of insulin available is continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with an insulin pump; however, insulin glargine is a useful alternative to pump therapy.
Use of today's rapid- and long-acting insulin analogues in intensive management protocols not only improves glycemic control but also reduces the risk of hypoglycemia. Therefore, safe achievement and maintenance of target glycemic goals are possible.

To determine the efficacy and safety of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy in a group of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Data from 17 patients were collected during the first year of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment. All patients were followed-up at our diabetic pediatric clinic. HbA1c, body mass index, insulin dose, severe hypoglycemic episodes, and diabetic ketoacidosis events before and after initiation of pump therapy were compared.
The mean age was 14.02 +/- 3.70 years and the mean diabetes duration was 5.81 +/- 3.31 years. HbA1c decreased from 8.12 +/- 1.46 to 7.52 +/- 0.87 % after 2 months of therapy and this decrease was maintained throughout the first year of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treatment. Insulin dose decreased from 0.99 +/- 0.24 to 0.84 +/- 0.18 U/kg/day after 1 year of treatment. Body mass index remained unchanged. There were fewer severe hypoglycemic events after the start of insulin pump therapy (0.47 +/- 1.23 events/patient in the 6 months before continuous insulin infusion, 0.29 +/- 1.20 episodes in the first 6 months of insulin pump therapy and 0.06 +/- 0.24 in the period from 6 to 12 months of the treatment). There were 3 ketoacidosis episodes, all in the same patient.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is a safe and effective alternative in the treatment of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus. It improves metabolic control and decreases the number of severe hypoglycemic episodes.

Classroom attention in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus: the effect of stabilizing serum glucose.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16492429/),"
To determine whether stabilizing serum glucose, via introduction of an insulin pump, improves classroom attention among children with type-1 diabetes mellitus.
Four boys having type-1 diabetes mellitus with unstable serum glucose were observed in their classroom for 10 baseline days. An insulin pump was placed and serum glucose stabilized, and they were then observed again for 10 days. A modified multiple baseline design was used to determine if improved on-task and off-task behavior was associated with better glycemic control. Rating scales and a laboratory measure of attention, measures of secondary interest, were also administered before and after pump introduction, and potential improvement in individuals' scores was evaluated.
All boys had apparent improvement in on-task and off-task behavior as observed in their classrooms. Improvements were substantial, averaging 20% in on-task behavior and 34% in off-task behavior. However, no changes were detected on rating scales or laboratory measures.
This study offers preliminary evidence that stabilizing serum glucose improves classroom attention, although the effect was detected only by observation of classroom behavior using highly structured techniques. Consequently, use of direct observation techniques may be important in studying the effects of chronic illness on classroom functioning.

Insulin pump therapy in childhood diabetes-cost implications for Primary Care Trusts.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16409571/),"
Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are now responsible for the planning and delivery of health-care services throughout England and Wales. As the 25 PCTs throughout Yorkshire are representative of the national distribution in terms of population structure and socio-economic status, we aimed to address the paucity of information describing the burden of childhood diabetes in primary care and to evaluate the cost implications of insulin pump therapy on individual PCTs.
We extracted information from a population-based register in Yorkshire, including 1952 patients diagnosed under the age of 15 years from 1990 to 2003. Each patient's postcode was linked to an individual PCT. Incidence rates (per 100 000 patient years) were derived and assessed for evidence of heterogeneity across PCTs and within Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs).
Incidence rates were lower in West Yorkshire (19.1, 95% CI 18.0-20.2) than North-east Yorkshire (20.3, 18.9-21.6), although this difference was not significant (P = 0.20). No significant evidence of heterogeneity in incidence rates was observed across PCTs (P = 0.46). Ninety per cent of all PCTs would expect four to seven newly diagnosed children per year, corresponding to a single general practitioner (GP) referring an individual for diagnosis once every 15 years on average. Assuming 1% of current patients under the age of 15 years with diabetes were to move onto insulin pump therapy, this would impose an additional cost of pound400-1300 per year for each PCT. The average cost was 15% lower for PCTs in West Yorkshire than North and East Yorkshire.
The additional resources required to pay for insulin pump therapy for a small proportion of the diabetes population would be minimal given the potential benefits to these patients of improved control and anticipated reduction in long-term morbidity.

Hypoglycemia in preschool children limits the effectiveness of insulin therapy. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is not widely used in this group.
This study was designed (1) to test the hypothesis that compared with twice-daily insulin injection, CSII decreases the SD of the mean daily blood glucose (BG) and improves glycemic control and (2) to evaluate the effect of CSII on parental anxiety using the Parental Stress Index (PSI) scale.
Ten subjects <6 years of age and receiving insulin injections were recruited. Each underwent two 72-h CGMS (Medtronic Minimed, Northridge, CA) monitoring periods and then was started on CSII and re-monitored 3 and 6 months later. We assessed the effects of CSII on the mean BG and SD of BG values, A1c, PSI scores, and number, distribution, and duration of hypoglycemic episodes.
Pooled pre- and post-CSII data were compared. There was a 22% decrease in the BG variability (mean +/- SD 93 +/- 19 mg/dL vs. 72 +/- 5 mg/dL; P = 0.02) and a 13% decrease in A1c (8.6 +/- 0.8% vs. 7.5 +/- 0.7%; P = 0.01). There was a decrease in the 24-h median number and duration of hypoglycemic episodes [1.16 vs. 0 episodes/24 h (P = 0.01) and 1.19 vs. 0.05 h/24 h (P = 0.01), respectively], as well as the median number and duration of nighttime episodes [0.83 vs. 0 episode/night (P = 0.008) and 0.98 vs. 0 h/night (P = 0.008), respectively]. We found no statistically significant change in the PSI score.

To compare the efficacy of insulin aspart and human soluble insulin used in insulin pump therapy on the islets beta cell function in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients.
Fifty-nine hospitalized newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients, 35 males and 24 females, aged 51 +/- 12, were and randomly divided into 2 groups to undergo insulin pump therapy with insulin aspart (aspart group, n = 30) or human soluble insulin (human insulin group, n = 29) for 2 weeks. The targets of glycemic control included fasting blood glucose (FBG) < 6.1 mmol/L and 2 h postprandial blood glucose (PBG) < 8.0 mmol/L. The changes of blood glucose, and the time and the doses of insulin needed for good glycemic control were compared between the two groups. The frequency of hypoglycemia and pump-related side effects were recorded.
On the 2nd day of insulin pump therapy, FBG and 3 meals PBG levels were significantly reduced in both groups while the post-breakfast and post-dinner blood glucose levels were far more decreased in the aspart group than in the human insulin group (8.4 mmol/L +/- 2.8 mmol/L vs 11.3 mmol/L +/- 3.8 mmol/L, and 9.0 mmol/L +/- 2.4 mmol/L vs 10.7 mmol/L +/- 2.8 mmol/L, both P < 0.05). The FBG and 3 meals PBG were significantly lowered in the aspart group than in the human insulin group on the 7th day and after the stopping of insulin pump therapy. The time of good glycemic control of the aspart group was 2.0 d, significantly shorter than that of the human insulin group (6.0 d, P < 0.01). The mean dose of insulin used during insulin pump therapy in the aspart group was 0.6 U/kg, significantly less than that in the human insulin group (0.8 U/kg, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in the AIR, mean area under the curve (AUC) of insulin and C peptide during IVGTT, HOMA-beta and proinsulin between the two groups before and after insulin pump therapy.

The use of insulin pumps is becoming a popular technique for insulin delivery among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), but there is no consensus regarding the guidelines for proper pump use during exercise.
To investigate the physiologic responses and risk of hypoglycemia among children and adolescents with T1DM when exercising with the pump on (PO) (50% of the basal rate) or pump off (PF).
Ten subjects with T1DM (6 female subjects and 4 male subjects), 10 to 19 years of age, performed prolonged exercise (40-45 minutes) on a cycle ergometer approximately 2 hours after a standard breakfast and an insulin (Lispro) bolus. Complex carbohydrates (20 g) were provided before and after the exercise. Each patient exercised once with PO and once with PF, in a randomized, crossover (single-blind) manner. During exercise and 45 minutes of recovery, subjects were monitored for cardiorespiratory, metabolic, and hormonal responses. Blood glucose concentrations were recorded for 24 hours after exercise, with a continuous glucose monitoring system, to document late hypoglycemic events.
During exercise, blood glucose concentrations decreased by 59 +/- 58 mg/dL (mean +/- SD: 29 +/- 24%) with PF and by 74 +/- 51 mg/dL (35.5 +/- 18%) with PO (not significant). No significant differences were found in cortisol, growth hormone, or noradrenaline levels between PO and PF. There were no differences in cardiorespiratory parameters, blood lactate concentrations, or free fatty acids concentrations between pump modes. Hypoglycemic events during exercise were asymptomatic and occurred for 2 subjects with PO and 2 with PF. Nine subjects had late hypoglycemia after PO, compared with 6 after PF (not significant).
We found no advantage for subjects with either PO or PF during exercise, and we noted that late hypoglycemia was more common than hypoglycemia during exercise. However, PO was associated with a trend of increased risk for late hypoglycemia. We recommend that the pump be removed or turned off during prolonged exercise and that blood glucose concentrations be monitored for several hours after exercise, regardless of the pump mode.

To describe the challenges and outcomes of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump therapy in a toddler and adolescent with type 1 diabetes. Insight into patient-family aspects motivating pump use is provided.
Two cases treated at the Pediatric Diabetes Clinic at Yale University.
Upon parental request, CSII was initiated to improve glycemic control in a 4-year-old boy (case 1) with unpredictable food intake. During 68 months of CSII therapy, hemoglobin A1C levels averaged 6.3% +/- 0.6%. Severe hypoglycemic episodes ceased 36 months ago, and occasional postprandial hyperglycemia during early school years was corrected with school nurses' reminders about premeal insulin bolus doses. Currently 9.5 years old, he independently manages all his insulin injections with parental assistance only to change the catheter site. Case 2 is a girl who was nearly 12 years of age when diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Initially managed with daily injections, hypoglycemic episodes were interfering with her physically active lifestyle. At age 13 years, she elected CSII therapy, and glycemic control improved. Temporarily erratic in the immediate period pre- and postmenarche, metabolic control has since stabilized. At 15 years old, she successfully manages her diabetes independently.
To optimize glycemic control, CSII can be initiated and used effectively, both in children of all ages and in adolescents with type 1 diabetes. CSII may be ideal therapy for toddlers, with no apparent lower age boundary for initiating CSII; however, the parenting challenges and requirements for supportive education differ between toddlers and adolescents. When disease and pump management are appropriately individualized, CSII therapy can help children with diabetes achieve and sustain glycemic control. Lifestyle flexibility, quality-of-life improvement, and independence can thus begin early in childhood and be maintained throughout young adulthood.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is used in selected type 1 diabetic subjects to achieve strict blood glucose control. A quarter of a century after its introduction, worldwide use of CSII is increasing. Review of controlled trials shows that, in most patients, mean blood glucose concentrations and glycated hemoglobin percentages are either slightly lower or similar on CSII versus multiple insulin injections. However, hypoglycemia is markedly less frequent than during intensive injection therapy. Ketoacidosis occurs at the same rate. Nocturnal glycemic control is improved with insulin pumps, and automatic basal rate changes help to minimize a pre-breakfast blood glucose increase (the ""dawn phenomenon"") often seen with injection therapy. Patients with ""brittle"" diabetes characterized by recurrent ketoacidosis are often not improved by CSII, although there may be exceptions. Insulin pump therapy has been shown to be beneficial in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes. Our experience with insulin pump therapy in young children, has been positive. Our young patients have had a reduction in HbA1c, mean blood glucose levels, and glycemic excursion; a decrease in episodes of severe hypoglycemia; and an increase in family functioning around diabetes. We believe the success of pump program in young patients can be attributed to the fact that we have employed appropriate criteria for patient selection and have a standardized method to initiate pump therapy and to follow and support our patients/ families. Experience with insulin-pump therapy indicates that candidates for CSII must be strongly motivated to improve self-monitoring of blood glucose, they must also understand and demonstrate use of the insulin pump.

Insulin pump therapy vs. multiple daily injections in obese Type 2 diabetic patients.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16026370/),"
To compare the efficacy of insulin pump treatment with multiple daily injections in the treatment of poorly controlled obese Type 2 diabetic patients already receiving two or more daily injections of insulin plus metformin.
Forty obese Type 2 diabetic subjects (using insulin) were randomized to treatment with continuous subcutaneous infusion pump (CSII) (Minimed) or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). At the end of the first 18-week treatment period, patients underwent a 12-week washout period during which they were treated with MDI plus metformin. They were then crossed-over to the other treatment for an 18-week follow-up period. Patients performed 4-point daily self blood-glucose monitoring (SBGM) on a regular basis and 7-point monitoring prior to visits 2, 8, 10 and 16. A subset of patients underwent continuous glucose monitoring using the Minimed(R) continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) at visits 2, 8, 10 and 16. A standard meal test was performed in which serum glucose was tested at fasting and once each hour for 6 h following a test meal. Glucose levels were plotted against time and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. HbA(1c), weight, daily insulin dose and hypoglycaemic episodes were recorded.
In obese Type 2 diabetic patients already treated with insulin, treatment with CSII significantly reduced HbA(1c) levels compared with treatment with MDI. An additional CSII treatment benefit was demonstrated by reduced meal-test glucose AUC. Initial reduction of daily insulin requirement observed in CSII-treated subjects during the first treatment period was attributable to a period effect and did not persist over time.
In the intent-to-treat analysis, CSII appeared to be superior to MDI in reducing HbA(1c) and glucose AUC values without significant change in weight or insulin dose in obese, uncontrolled, insulin-treated Type 2 diabetic subjects.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in type 1 diabetic Saudi children. A comparison with conventional insulin therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15983674/),"
To assess the efficacy and effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in type 1 diabetic Saudi children in comparison with conventional insulin (CI) therapy.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was initiated in 14 Saudi children with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) through insulin pump therapy between October 2002 and June 2004. All children were followed at the Diabetes Clinic, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The patients were initially on CI therapy, which is usually defined as 2 or fewer insulin injections per day before shifting them to CSII. The patients were trained on carbohydrates counting and started on continuously basal insulin infusion aside from the meal and high blood glucose correction insulin boluses.
The patients included in the study had T1DM for a mean duration of 6 years. The age of the children ranged from 4-18 years. They were followed on insulin pump therapy for a mean duration of 10 months. There was a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c, mean blood glucose level, total insulin requirement, frequency of hypoglycemic episodes and frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) events during CSII therapy.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion improved the glycemic control in diabetic Saudi children with decreased frequency of hypoglycemic episodes and DKA events. Long follow-up studies are needed to confirm these results.

Patient management of long-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15963182/),"
This paper reports a study of patients' current practice with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions, particularly with respect to the management of the pump.
Successful implementation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion requires a motivated patient with a range of technical skills and self-management capabilities. The therapy should be prescribed, implemented and monitored by a skilled professional team familiar with it and capable of supporting the patient.
A questionnaire was mailed to 102 continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion treated patients at a Swedish university hospital with experience of pump treatment for at least 6 months.
The questionnaire was answered by 88% of the patients, 53 women and 37 men, aged 22-71 years with a duration of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion use of between 7 months and 19 years. The changing interval for soft infusion set ranged from 2.0 to 10.0 days (mean 4.8) and for metal needles from 1.5 to 7.5 days (mean 3.8), P = 0.001. Catheter occlusions were significantly more often reported in patients with presence of bleeding at the infusion site (P = 0.011) and among those using insulin lispro (P = 0.032).
Patients having long-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion should be carefully audited with respect to the management of the insulin pump and its accessories. In patients who frequently experience problems, shorter intervals between changes of infusion sets are strongly advocated and type of insulin preparation may be of importance in some cases.

[Pregnancy in type 1 diabetes: insulin pump versus intensified conventional therapy].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15927506/),"
To evaluate and compare the outcome of pregnancies in women with type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin pump or multiple insulin injections.
Thirty-three patients treated with pump, 23 with multiple injections. Were mainly investigated: glycemic control (HbA1C), fetal outcome (congenital malformations, preterm delivery, perinatal mortality), rates of gestational hypertension and cesarean section.
HbA1C (1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester) with pump was not significantly different from that obtained with multiple injections (respectively, 7.5 +/- 1.24 vs 7.6 +/- 1.4; 6.34 +/- 0.6 vs 6.6 +/- 0.8; 6.6 +/- 0.7 vs 6.4 +/- 0.7). Fetal prognosis was also similar. The occurrence of gestational hypertension was linked to diabetic complications [OR 5,7, IC95% 1.24-25, p = 0.0025]. The rate of cesarean section (70% in women treated with pump) was influenced by diabetes duration. In planned pregnancy, independently of therapeutic device, HbA1C during organogenesis was better (6.9% +/- 0.78 vs 8.51 +/- 1.3, p < 0.0001) with no perinatal death and no major congenital malformation.
Fetal prognosis is not overall significantly different with insulin pump compared with intensified conventional therapy. The initiation of insulin pump therapy should not be systematic. Instead, the benefits risks ratio must be assessed resulting in a tailored prescription according to individual needs. This therapeutic choice should be discussed before conception, as planned pregnancy is a main prognostic factor. Diabetes duration and complications remain key factors for the prognosis.

Insulin pump therapy in childhood diabetes mellitus: guidelines for use.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15871551/),"
The current goals for the therapy of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus are to achieve near-normal glycemia, minimize the risk of severe hypoglycemia, limit excessive weight gain while achieving adequate growth, improve quality of life for both the patients and their families, and delay or prevent vascular complications. Insulin pump therapy provides a treatment option that can significantly aid in achieving all of these goals across all age ranges of pediatric patients. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) pump therapy can provide greater flexibility in the timing of meals and snacks, has programmable basal rates to optimize overnight glycemic control, can reduce the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia, and enhances the ability of the patient and the family members to achieve acceptable diabetes control. In pediatric patients, CSII has been shown to reduce both glycosylated hemoglobin levels and the frequency of severe hypoglycemia without increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. The effectiveness of CSII, improvements in pump technology, and the availability of very rapid-acting insulin analogs have fueled a dramatic increase in the use of this therapy. This review presents practical guidelines for the selection of patients, initiation of treatment and patient education, as well as guidelines for use while exercising and at school. Keys to the success of CSII are to have a multidisciplinary team of clinicians who are expert in the care of children with diabetes, and patients and families who are able to carry out the tasks of intensive treatment, including self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, carbohydrate counting, and infusion pump management. Patients and parents need to be able to recognize and treat hypoglycemia, and prevent the development of ketoacidosis. School personnel need to be involved in the treatment plan and individual algorithms developed for periods of extra exercise and activity. The recent introduction of methods for continuous glucose monitoring provides a new means to optimize the basal and bolus capabilities of CSII and offers hope for the development of a feedback-controlled artificial pancreas.

What could be the reasons for giving up the implanted pump treatment?,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15803119/),"
The development of implanted insulin pump treatment has been particularly intense in France and French implanting centers joined to form an association called EVADIAC. The data collected by EVADIAC have clearly documented benefits as well possible problems with this treatment mode. In comparison with SC administration, intraperitoneal (IP) insulin infusion via an implanted pump achieves good metabolic control, improves long-term stability of diabetes and significantly reduces the risk of severe hypoglycemia. Problems can involve pump slowdown, catheter obstruction or local complication at the implantation site. With respect to the benefits, the rate of complications is highly acceptable. However, amongst the implanted diabetic patients, some elect to give up such a treatment mode. In a retrospective study we intended to examine their reasons for giving up this treatment. In our center, the patients who elected by themselves to give up the implanted pump account for 16% of all treated patients. This group of patients did not have, as compared to other implanted patients, less benefits nor more restrictions or incidents that could have impaired their well being. The reasons for giving up the implanted pump seem more often to be related to the refusal of a strict and institutional management linked to this treatment.

Optimizing insulin therapy in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15799217/),"
Pregnancy complicated by type 1 diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of complications in the mother and infant. Normal or near normal glycemic control prior to and during pregnancy reduces many of these risks to levels observed in the general population. This degree of glycemic control is generally achievable only with intensive insulin therapy: multiple daily injections (MDI) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via an insulin pump. These therapeutic regimens have been found to result in comparable glycemic control, although CSII provides increased flexibility in terms of patient lifestyle, and may reduce the incidence of hypoglycemia. Frequent home blood glucose monitoring is imperative during pregnancy in order to optimize glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. Furthermore, insulin requirements change significantly over the course of pregnancy. The new short-acting insulin analogs, insulin lispro and insulin aspart, have pharmacodynamic properties which make them ideal for use during pregnancy. Although the number of published studies evaluating the use of insulin lispro during pregnancy is limited, the majority support its safety. No studies of insulin aspart in pregnancy have been published in full. In addition to optimization of glycemic control, frequent assessment for development and/or progression of microvascular complications is necessary during pregnancy.

Insulin pump use in young adolescents with type 1 diabetes: a descriptive study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15787898/),"
There is little research on psychosocial factors and insulin pump use in adolescents. The purpose of the present study was to use qualitative and quantitative methods to explore psychosocial issues related to insulin pump use [continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)] in youth. Eighteen early adolescents and their parents were interviewed about the experience of using an insulin pump, and transcripts were content-analyzed. In general, interviewees reported modest improvements in glycemic control with initiation of CSII. Teens and parents did, however, report high levels of satisfaction with pump therapy and increased adolescent responsibility for the diabetes regimen. In addition, pump users reported few issues related to body image, appearance, or social aspects of pump dependency. Chief concerns were related to the demands of initiating pump therapy, pump alarms and malfunctions, potential for regimen non-compliance with CSII, and school-related issues. Pump use is not associated with social difficulties, and, in general, youths and their parents report high satisfaction with CSII.

[Effectiveness of selected methods of the short-term intensive insulin therapy in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15675270/),"
Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus can be an indication for hospitalisation and short-term intensive insulin therapy. There are different forms of such therapy i.e. multiple daily injections (MDI), continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or continuous intravenous insulin infusion (IVII). The aim of our study was to compare the efficacy of these methods of intensive insulin therapy. The following parameters were measured: 1) time period needed for ""near normoglycaemia"" establishment and 2) mean daily glucose values reduction as a result of the treatment applied. 60 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (daily blood glucose profile values > 250 mg/dl) treated with insulin twice daily were enrolled into the study. Patients were randomly divided into three groups: CSII, IVII and MDI. CSII as realized through subcutaneous insulin pump model MiniMed 508, IVII through intravenous pump model Duet standard 50-Kwapisz and MDI was based on four insulin injections per day in bolus--basal fashion. Intensive insulin therapy was continued until satisfying daily glucose profile achievement (80-180 mg/dl). After ""near normoglycaemia"" attainment, a conventional insulin therapy was introduced through subcutaneous insulin dosage. Significant reduction of mean daily glucose values as result of applied treatment was observed in all the groups examined. The degree of glycaemia reduction amounted 60 mg/dl for CSII and 85 mg/dl for IVII. There was no statistical significant difference between treated groups. Mean duration of intensive insulin therapy until ""near normoglycaemia"" establishment was significantly longer in MDI as compared to CSII and IVII groups (6 days vs. 4.45 and 5.2 respectively). Short-term intensive insulin therapy by MDI, CSII and IVII gives good glycemic control and significantly reduces mean daily glucose values, but this aim can be achieved most quickly using CSII and IVII.

Parents' reflections on managing their children's diabetes with insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15636411/),"
To describe the experiences of parents managing the type 1 diabetes of their young children using an insulin pump.
Qualitative description, based on principles of naturalistic inquiry.
Open-ended, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 mothers and fathers of 16 children less than 12 years old in the eastern part of the United States. The children had been on pump treatment from 3 to 36 months. Data were managed and analyzed using qualitative content analysis.
Parents reported becoming comfortable with pump management 10 days to 2-3 months after the child started using it. During this adjustment period, they had to ""rethink"" how they managed the disease. Although using the pump required vigilance and more frequent glucose checking than did multiple daily injections (MDI), the pump provided better glucose control, easier disease management, fewer variables to manipulate, and more flexible meal times. A few parents were tempted to more tightly control the child's glucose levels, which could potentially increase parental stress. Fathers were actively involved in the day-to-day management and benefited from opportunities to participate in the child's care. They emphasized the importance of practicing the tasks associated with diabetes management to improve their confidence when caring for the child alone. Parents reported that everyone in the family experienced more freedom, flexibility, and spontaneity in their daily lives.
For this sample of parents, the health and management benefits of their children's use of the insulin pump outweighed the adjustment challenges involved in changing from MDI.

A two-center randomized controlled feasibility trial of insulin pump therapy in young children with diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15616227/),"
Our goals were to determine if continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), compared with those continuing multiple daily injections (MDIs), can be safely used in young children, if those on CSII will have superior glycemic control, if subjects using CSII will have less hypoglycemia for their level of control, and if families using CSII will report an improved quality of life.
We conducted a randomized 1-year feasibility trial comparing CSII with continuing MDIs in preschool children with a history of type 1 diabetes for at least 6 months' duration. Prospective outcomes included measures of overall glycemic control (HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring system), the incidence of severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis, the percent of glucose values below 3.9 mmol/l, and the parents' report of quality of life.
The 19 subjects' ages ranged from 1.7 to 6.1 (mean 3.6) years, duration of diabetes ranged from 0.6 to 2.6 (mean 1.4) years, and baseline HbA1c ranged from 6.7 to 9.6% (mean 7.9%). Seven subjects were male. Nine subjects were randomized to start CSII and 10 to continue on MDI. All baseline characteristics were well balanced. Overall metabolic control, diabetes quality of life, and the incidence of hypoglycemia were similar in the two groups. No subject had diabetic ketoacidosis, while one subject in each group had an episode of severe hypoglycemia. No CSII subject discontinued using the pump during or after the study.
CSII can be a safe and effective method to deliver insulin in young children.

To determine the impact of insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion) on key parameters of diabetes management including quality of life in children and adolescents with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM).
All patients started on insulin pump therapy were prospectively followed before and after institution of insulin pump therapy. Data collected included age, duration of diabetes, glycated haemoglobin levels (HbA1c), anthropometric data and episodes of severe hypoglycaemia defined as hypoglycaemia resulting in coma or convulsion. A subset of patients also completed the Diabetes Quality of Life Instrument (DQOL) and Self-Efficacy for Diabetes Scale (SED) questionnaires to assess quality of life.
At the time of analysis, 100 patients had been managed with insulin pump therapy. The mean age when starting pump therapy was 12.5 (3.9-19.6) years. Duration of therapy ranged from 0.2 to 4.0 years (mean 1.4 years, median 1.5 years). HbA1c decreased from 8.3 +/- 0.1% prior to pump therapy to 7.8 +/- 0.1% (P < 0.0001). Episodes of severe hypoglycaemia decreased from 32.9 to 11.4 per 100 patient years. Components of quality of life measures showed improvement on pump treatment. BMI standard deviation scores (z scores) did not increase.
Pump therapy is proving an effective means of insulin therapy in the young patient that shows promise to improve glycaemic control with a reduction in hypoglycaemia frequency. Quality of Life measures suggest that psychosocial outcomes may be improved.

A Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) - a promising approach for improving metabolic control in persons with type 1 Diabetes mellitus treated by insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15523543/),"
This pilot study deals with the possibilities of a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS, Minimed- Medtronic) to optimize insulin substitution. Ten persons with type 1 diabetes mellitus treated by means of an insulin pump entered the study and eight of them completed the protocol. CGMS was introduced for a period of 5 days. The standard dinner (60 g of carbohydrates) and overnight fasting were designed to ensure standard night conditions in all persons in the study while maintaining their usual daily eating routine, physical exercise and assessment of prandial insulin boluses. The only adaptation of basal rates of insulin pump was performed on day 3. Comparison of the mean plasma glucose concentration (0:00-24:00 hrs) between day 2 (before adaptation) and day 4 (following adaptation) was made. An independent comparison of the mean plasma glucose concentration between the night from day 2 till day 3 (22:00-6:00 hrs) and the night from day 4 till day 5 (22:00-6:00 hrs) was performed. The mean plasma glucose investigated by means of CGMS improved in the 24-hour period in 5 out of 8 persons and in the night fasting period (22:00 to 6 hrs) in 6 out of 8 persons. The CGMS is a useful means for assessment of the effectiveness of basal rate and prandial insulin doses in persons with type 1 diabetes treated by means of an insulin pump. However, further studies are necessary to improve the algorithm for insulin substitution.

Absorption rates of phosphate buffered insulin analogs aspart and lispro prevail over regular human insulin. However, insulin aspart has not been widely used. The aim of this open controlled clinical study is to compare the metabolic effects of insulin aspart and phosphate buffered insulin when both are used in insulin pumps according to the identical algorithms.
Twenty one persons aged 39.9 +/- 2.89 (mean +/- SE) years (y) with type 1 diabetes mellitus duration of 17.9 +/- 2.21 y treated by an insulin pump for 4.3 +/- 0.53 y (at least 3 months), educated in self monitoring, entered the study. Mean plasma glucose, rates of hypo- and hyperglycaemias from the glucometer memory and other data from the first 256 +/- 19.97 days period with regular human insulin (check-up 1 and 2) and consequent 364 +/- 8.78 days long period with insulin aspart (check-up 3 and 4) were compared (paired t-test). Replacement of human regular insulin with insulin aspart after two check-ups was the only change in the treatment of diabetes. No special therapeutic education or training was made during the study.
In persons with type 1 diabetes treated by an insulin pump with insulin aspart, despite the lower daily dose of insulin aspart vs human regular insulin, the HbA1c decreased; the frequency of hypo- and hyperglycaemias and the BMI did not change.
Insulin analog aspart appears to be more effective for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion than regular human insulin.

Clinical and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15488165/),"
To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) in the delivery of intensive insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes mellitus.
Electronic databases, references of retrieved articles and manufacturer submissions. Experts in the field were consulted.
For the systematic review of clinical and cost-effectiveness, studies were assessed for inclusion according to predefined criteria by two reviewers. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Data on clinical effectiveness were synthesised through a narrative review with full tabulation of all eligible studies, with meta-analysis performed where appropriate.
Twenty studies comparing CSII with MDI were identified. Quality was generally poor. In adults with Type 1 diabetes, glycated haemoglobin improved by 0.61% (95% CI -1.29 to 0.07) in longer term studies, although this improvement was smaller when a study using bovine ultralente was excluded. A reduction in insulin dose with CSII of about 12 units per day (-11.90, 95% CI -18.16 to 5.63) was found in short-term studies, with smaller differences in longer term studies. Body weight and cholesterol levels were similar between treatments. Hypoglycaemic events did not differ significantly between CSII and MDI in most trials, but some found fewer events with CSII and one found more hypoglycaemia and hypoglycaemic coma with CSII. There was no consistency between the studies in patient preference, but progress has been made both with insulin pumps and injector pens since the publication of many of the older studies. No difference in glycated haemoglobin between CSII and MDI was found in pregnancy; one study found less insulin was required by patients with CSII, but two other studies found no significant difference. One study of adolescents found lower glycated haemoglobin and insulin dose with CSII whereas a second study found no significant difference. In CSII analogue insulin was associated with lower glycated haemoglobin levels than soluble insulin. No economic evaluations comparing CSII with MDI were identified. The estimated additional cost of CSII compared to MDI varies from GBP1091 per annum to GBP1680 per annum, according to the make of the insulin pump and the estimated life of the device. These estimates include the costs for the insulin pump, the consumables associated with delivery of CSII, and an allowance for the initial education required when patients switch from MDI to CSII. The largest component of the annual cost for CSII is the cost of consumable items (e.g. infusion sets).
When compared with optimised MDI, CSII results in a modest but worthwhile improvement in glycated haemoglobin in adults with Type 1 diabetes. It has not been possible to establish the longer term benefits of such a difference in glycated haemoglobin, although there is an expectation that it would be reflected in a reduction in long-term complications. More immediate primary benefits from CSII may be associated with an impact on the incidence of hypoglycaemic events and the dawn phenomenon, and greater flexibility of lifestyle. However, there is limited evidence on this, and information presented to offer context on quality-of-life is based on testimonies from those patients who have had a positive experience of CSII. The estimated cost to the NHS per year for CSII would be around GBP3.5 million in England and Wales if 1% of people with Type 1 diabetes used CSII, GBP10.5 million for 3%, and GBP17.5 million for 5%. Further research should focus on wider benefits of CSII, such as flexibility of lifestyle and quality of life, and on the psychological impact of wearing a device for 24 hours every day. Research into the use of CSII in children of different ages is also needed.

Assessment of glycemic control by continuous glucose monitoring system in 50 children with type 1 diabetes starting on insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15450005/),"
To report experience with a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) and to identify factors influencing glycemic control in a large cohort of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and change to insulin pump therapy via continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).
In 50 patients [21 boys, 29 girls; median age 12.6 yr (range: 1.3-16.4 yr); diabetes duration 5.0 yr (0.2-13.3)], hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and ambulatory CGMS were performed before and 6 wk after starting CSII. Average glucose concentration per 24 h, during day and night time as well as number of excursions, duration, and area under the curve (AUC) of glucose values above 180 mg/dL and below 60 mg/dL were calculated from CGMS data. Simultaneously, metabolic control was documented by standardized self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG).
In the total cohort, HbA1c improved from 8.1 +/- 1.2% at baseline to 7.7 +/- 0.9% after 6 wk of CSII (p <0.001). This effect was more distinct in boys (8.0 +/- 1.4 vs. 7.5 +/- 1.1%, p=0.007) than in girls (8.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.8 +/- 0.7%, p=0.039) as well as in patients with poor glycemic control (HbA1c >8.0%) at baseline (8.9 +/- 0.6 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.8%, p <0.001) and in those older than 12 yr (8.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 7.7 +/- 1.0%, p <0.001). At 6 wk of CSII, the values of glucose average per 24 h, AUC and time above 180 mg/dL, particularly during the day, improved. HbA1c was correlated with AUC above 180 mg/dL (r=0.742, p <0.001) and CGMS average glucose per 24 h (r=0.628, p=0.002), but to a lesser extent with SMBG values (r=0.418, p=0.054).
With the change to CSII, HbA1c improved significantly after 6 wk of therapy. CGMS usage provided additional information about glycemic control in these patients.

To compare glycemic control, safety, and parental satisfaction in preschool-aged diabetic children randomized to treatment either with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or intensive insulin injection therapy.
This clinical trial enrolled 42 patients <5 years of age who had been diagnosed with diabetes for at least 12 months. Children were randomly assigned to CSII (n = 21) or intensive insulin injection therapy (n = 21). Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was measured at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Secondary outcomes included severe hypoglycemic events, meter-detected hypoglycemia, blood sugar variability, body mass index (BMI), and satisfaction with therapy.
Thirty-seven patients completed 6 months of therapy. There was a significant decrease in HbA1c during the study period for both groups (from 8.9% +/- 0.6% to 8.6% +/- 0.6% at 3- and 6-month visits). At 3 months, children using pumps had a significantly lower HbA1c than the injection group (8.4% vs 8.8%); however, by 6 months the two groups were similar (8.5% vs 8.7%). No differences in pre-meal blood sugar variabilities were seen between groups. Children on pumps had increases in the number of meter-detected episodes of hypoglycemia. Pump therapy was safe and well tolerated. No episodes of ketoacidosis occurred in either group, whereas one hypoglycemic seizure occurred in each group. Parents reported satisfaction with CSII, with 95% of families continuing on CSII beyond the 6-month study period.
Pump therapy in preschool-aged children was not associated with clinically significant differences in glycemic control as compared with intensive injection therapy. The rationale for initiating CSII in this age group should be based on patient selection and lifestyle preference.

"[Emergency landing due to a passanger with chest pain, dyspnea, and vomiting].",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15332725/),"
A 20-year old student had suffered since 3 years from diabetes mellitus type I, which was well-controlled by insulin-pump therapy. During a flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, the student all of a sudden had chest pain, dyspnea, and he vomitted repetitively--emergency landing at Zurich airport was necessary. The student presented at the emergency unit in a poor general condition with tachypnea (32/min) and tachycardia (136/min). Arterial blood gas analysis showed severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.04), while pulmonary or cardiac disease could be ruled out. Diabetic ketoacidosis was caused by the pump running short of insulin. Treatment included rehydration and administration of insulin. Administration of insulin by an insulin-pump allows to continuously and flexibly adjust the dosage according to the requirement of the body. Interruption of insulin administration can cause, however, relatively fast ketoacidosis because exclusively short-acting insulin is used.

Rediscovery of insulin pump treatment of childhood type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15272243/),"
Currently, goals for the treatment of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus are to achieve near normal glycemia; minimize the risks of severe hypoglycemia and excessive weight gain; optimize psychosocial functioning and quality of life (for children and their families); and prevent or delay long-term microvascular complications. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), or insulin pump therapy, provides a treatment option that can assist in the attainment of all of these goals in all ages of children. Insulin pump therapy provides the opportunity for greater flexibility in meal timing and content due to the convenience of its bolus delivery of insulin. Insulin pump therapy can potentially reduce the risk of exercise-related and nocturnal hypoglycemia, through the use of programmable variable basal infusion rates. In pediatric patients, usage of CSII has been demonstrated to reduce both glycosylated hemoglobin levels and frequency of severe hypoglycemia, without sacrifices in safety, quality of life, or weight gain, particularly in conjunction with the use of new insulin analogs and improvements in pump technology. Clinical studies of safety and efficacy of CSII in children and the use of continuous glucose monitoring to optimize insulin pump therapy are reviewed.

Assessment of therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in an academic diabetes clinic.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15251828/),"
To assess the results of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, especially relative to glycemic control and rate of discontinuation of insulin pump therapy.
A retrospective review of the medical records of 107 patients with type 1 diabetes who were receiving CSII at the Diabetes Care Center at the University of Washington Medical Center was performed to evaluate clinical outcomes. All patients considering CSII therapy participated in a class to learn the details of insulin pump treatment.
The mean age of our patient population was 36.0 +/- 10.4 years (mean value +/- standard deviation). The mean duration of diabetes at the initiation of insulin pump therapy was 17.0 +/- 9.1 years. The mean duration of CSII use was 36.1 +/- 25.5 months (median, 26.2 months). Insulin lispro was used by 89.7% of the patients. Six patients (5.6%) discontinued CSII therapy after a mean of 19.1 +/- 14.7 months for a variety of reasons. Despite no significant difference in home blood glucose monitoring (number of tests per day) before initiation of CSII, mean hemoglobin A1c levels decreased from 7.6% to 7.1% (P<0.0001), and the occurrence of severe hypoglycemic episodes decreased 73.8% (P = 0.0003).
In our academic diabetes clinic with a formal insulin pump program, we noted a significant improvement in hemoglobin A1c values, a significant reduction in the frequency of severe hypoglycemic episodes, and a low rate of discontinuation of CSII. CSII therapy, when provided in conjunction with a standard educational program, should continue to be an important treatment option in appropriately selected patients with type 1 diabetes.

Effect of implanted insulin pumps on fluorescein transcapillary escape time in type 1 diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15251748/),"
To determine whether significant increases in fluorescein transcapillary escape time (FTET) would occur after treatment of patients with type 1 diabetes with insulin delivered intraperitoneally by a surgically implanted pump.
Nine patients with type 1 diabetes who were otherwise healthy and had received surgically implanted insulin pumps on a study protocol were recruited to have three measurements of FTET and glycosylated hemoglobin during an 18-month period. Serum fluorescein-albumin binding was measured at the time of the final test. Control FTETs were measured in 46 patients with type 1 diabetes who did not have insulin pumps and in 15 adults without diabetes.
In the implanted insulin pump group, 50% of the FTETs were below normal, but no significant longitudinal change in FTETs was noted in eight of the nine study patients. The mean FTETs in the implanted insulin pump group were significantly higher than those of the control patients with diabetes but without insulin pumps (mean, 88 versus 62 seconds; P<0.05) but significantly lower than those of the control subjects without diabetes (88 versus 163 seconds; P<0.001). Four of the nine patients with implanted insulin pumps had normal FTETs on all three studies. This subgroup had used insulin pumps (external + implanted) for significantly longer periods (6.2 versus 2.6 years; P<0.05) than the other five patients. These differences within the implanted pump group did not correlate with differences in glycosylated hemoglobin values or fluorescein-albumin binding; however, the glycosylated hemoglobin levels before insulin pump implantation were significantly lower than those of the other five patients. Three patients with onset of type 1 diabetes before age 10 years had the lowest FTETs.
Implanted insulin pumps did not alter FTETs between 6 months and 32 months after pump implantation. Total time on insulin pumps (external and implanted) is associated with normal FTET, and onset of diabetes before age 10 years is associated with abnormal FTET.

Insulin pump therapy for 1-6 year old children with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15151368/),"
The management of diabetes in preschool children poses unique difficulties for both the families and the medical team.
To test the feasibility and safety of insulin pump therapy in the 1-6 year age group in order to improve quality of life and metabolic control.
The study group comprised 15 type 1 diabetic children aged 1-6 years old (mean +/- SD, 3.8 +/- 1.2 years) from three diabetes centers. Insulin pump therapy was applied for 12 months. Data, including insulin dose, hemoglobin A1c, hypoglycemic events, as well as scores on the Diabetes Quality of Life Measure Questionnaire and the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire, were collected and compared with the multiple daily injection treatment prior to entry into the study,
HbA1c was measured at the beginning of the study and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 months later; the respective levels (mean +/- SD) were 8.82 +/- 0.98, 8.45 +/- 1.05, 8.37 +/- 0.85, 8.32 +/- 0.71, 8.18 +/- 0.90%. HbA1c measurements after 12 months were significantly lower than at the beginning of the study (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in insulin dose and the total number of hypoglycemic events. In both the DQOL and DTSQ scales there were significant differences in scores in favor of the insulin pump period (43.7 +/- 8.0 versus 33.7 +/- 7.9, P < 0.001; and 10.9 +/- 2.3 versus 14.5 +/- 2.3, P < 0.001), respectively.
For very young diabetic children, insulin pump therapy improves quality of life and is feasible and safe. It should be considered as an optional mode of therapy for this age group.

Current perspectives on the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in the acute care setting and overview of therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15137359/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), also called the insulin pump, has emerged as a safe and effective therapy in the last 20 years. Utilization of CSII in several studies has shown reductions in hypoglycemia and improvement in glycemic control compared with multiple daily injections. Diabetes mellitus is often a comorbid condition in patients requiring critical care. Surprisingly, there exist no guidelines for use of CSII in the inpatient setting, and no tested protocols for management of CSII in the hospital. With solid evidence as to the benefits of this therapy in diabetes and the heightened attention to the importance of optimal inpatient glycemic control, guidelines and tested protocols for CSII use during hospitalization are warranted. We share our own guidelines for the inpatient management of the insulin pump which has allowed our hospital to address the unique challenges that pump users present with during acute illness. A general overview of the insulin pump's history, rationale for use, patient selection, and implementation is also discussed.

Continuous glucose monitoring in children with type 1 diabetes: before and after insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15043684/),"
The aim of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is to mimic as closely as possible the normal physiologic pattern seen in individuals without diabetes. This study was undertaken to determine the specific areas of improved glycemic control in subjects after initiation of insulin pump therapy and times where further improvement is needed.
Eight patients with T1DM (age 7.5-17 yr) wore the Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (CGMS) (Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA, USA) for 3 d before and 3 months after initiation of insulin pump therapy. The CGMS, which measures inter- stitial glucose concentrations every 5 min for a 72-h period, was used to evaluate glucose profiles. Patients entered 4-5 fingerstick blood glucose measurements daily into the sensor for calibration. Detailed logs of food intake, exercise, and hypoglycemic symptoms were also recorded.
Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) was reduced (p < 0.007) following 3 months of insulin pump therapy. Post-CSII continuous glucose profiles demonstrated an overall improvement in hourly mean glucose over a 24-h period (p < 0.001) as well as a reduction in the area under the curve for glucose (27 +/- 4 prepump vs. 8.6 +/- 1.4 mg/dL/d postpump, p < 0.004). This improvement was a result of an attenuation of the maximal postprandial glycemic excursions. Postbreakfast 349 +/- 24 vs. 267 +/- 16 mg/dL, p < 0.003; lunch 340 +/- 16 vs. 217 +/- 20 mg/dL, p < 0.003. Postdinner average similarly decreased after 3 months of CSII by 22%, p < 0.04.

Insulin pumps: what every school nurse needs to know.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15040760/),"
The results of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial revolutionized the care of people with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). The era of ""tight control"" of blood sugars to decrease microvascular complications dawned. The subsequent technological development of insulin pumps has made it possible for individuals with Type 1 DM, as well as those with Type 2 who are insulin dependent, to keep their blood sugars in a more normal range. Children of all ages with Type 1 DM have been switching from multiple daily injections of insulin to insulin pumps. School nurses who have not had a child with a pump certainly will in the near future. It is important for school nurses to understand the function and possible complications of using an insulin pump to assist and support children in their transition to pump therapy. School nurses need to be aware of available technical support resources for insulin pumps should problems arise at school with pump management.

Insulin pump therapy in pediatrics: a therapeutic alternative to safely lower HbA1c levels across all age groups.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15016169/),"
To examine the efficacy and safety of using continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in a large group of patients 18 months to 18 yr from a single pediatric diabetes program.
All patients < or = 18 yr of age starting on CSII from 1 January 1997 to 31 March 2000 at the Yale Children's Diabetes Program were included. Clinical data were collected prospectively before and during pump treatment. HbA1c was the primary efficacy outcome and rates of diabetes-related adverse events were the primary safety measures.
One hundred and sixty-one children ranging in age from 18 months to 18 yr received CSII for an average of 32 +/- 9 months when data collection was closed on 31 October 2001, including 26 preschoolers (< 7 yr), 76 school-agers (7-11 yr) and 59 adolescents (12-18 yr). Mean HbA1c levels were 7.1% in the preschoolers, 7.8% in the school-agers and 8.1% in the adolescents prior to the start of CSII. There was a significant and consistent reduction in mean HbA1c levels after 12 months of CSII (to 6.5% in preschoolers, 7.3% in school-agers and 7.4% in adolescents, p < 0.02 vs. prepump) that was maintained at the most recent visit. Improved diabetes control was achieved with CSII without increasing daily insulin doses and in association with a decrease in the frequency of severe hypoglycemic events (p < 0.05 vs. prepump, all three age groups combined).
CSII is an effective alternative to injection therapy in a large pediatric diabetes clinic setting. Even very young patients can utilize CSII to safely lower HbA1c levels.

This study compared external insulin pump treatment using insulin lispro or insulin aspart with multiple daily injections (MDI; four or more injections per day) using insulin glargine and insulin lispro or insulin aspart. An electronic database was used to retrieve various parameters of glycemic control for 515 adult patients with type 1 diabetes. An insulin pump was used by 216 patients, and 299 patients were taking insulin glargine for at least 6 months. The mean age (approximately 33 years), duration of diabetes (approximately 16 years), and duration of treatment (approximately 12 months) were similar for both the pump and insulin glargine groups. The mean (+/-SEM) A1C values were significantly reduced in both groups from the baseline to the end of the study (7.7 +/- 0.1% to 7.5 +/- 0.1% for the pump group and 8.0 +/- 0.1% to 7.7 +/- 0.1% for the insulin glargine group, P< 0.001) with similar weight gain (P> 0.05) in both groups. The insulin glargine group significantly reduced basal insulin intake at follow-up. The premeal boluses were similar throughout the study for both groups. The subjects reporting severe hypoglycemic episodes were similar in the two groups; however, there were 12 cases of diabetic ketoacidosis reported in the pump group and none in the insulin glargine group. Patients with type 1 diabetes can achieve similar glycemic control using insulin glargine with premeal insulin lispro or by using an external infusion pump with insulin lispro or insulin aspart. However, costs and episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis are significantly higher for insulin pump users.

To identify possible causes of suboptimal glycemic control (ascertained by hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] level) in youths using insulin pump therapy.
Forty-eight youths who were receiving insulin pump therapy for > or =6 months, and who were using insulin pumps and blood glucose meters with data that could be downloaded at our facility, are included in this cross-sectional study. Possible causes of suboptimal glycemic control were evaluated by using 4 information sources: 1) insulin pump data downloads; 2) glucose meter data downloads; 3) patient/family questionnaire about insulin bolusing habits, eating habits, exercise, and blood glucose testing habits; and 4) a physician questionnaire. Physicians completed the questionnaire during the patient interview after reviewing the downloaded information and discussing these results with the patient/family.
The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of participants was 15.3 (+/-3.0) years (range: 7-20 years), and the mean (+/- standard deviation) duration of type 1 diabetes and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion was 8.2 (+/-4.0) and 1.9 (+/-1.0) years, respectively. Patients who missed <1 bolus per week had a mean (95% confidence interval) HbA1c level of 8.0% (7.7, 8.3), whereas those who missed > or =1 mealtime boluses per week had a mean HbA1c level (95% confidence interval) of 8.8% (8.6, 9.1). No significant relationships were found between HbA1c levels in males and females, the amount of exercise per week, or bolusing before insulin pump disconnection for exercise. Although not significant, a trend was found for those who missed <1 bolus per week to perform more blood glucose tests per day and for those who bolused before a meal rather than after to have lower HbA1c levels. Significant correlations were found between HbA1c levels and the number of missed mealtime boluses per week (r =.414) and mean blood glucose levels (r =.70).
Missed mealtime insulin boluses seem to be the major cause of suboptimal glycemic control in youths with diabetes receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy.

We compared the accuracy and precision of low-dose insulin administration using various devices including, for the first time, an insulin pump. We dispensed 1, 2, and 5 unit(s) of soluble insulin (100 units/mL) 15 times each from a NovoPen (3.0 mL), a BD-Mini Pen (1.5 mL), a Humalog Pen (100 units/mL), 30G Precision Sure-Dose Insulin Syringes, 30G BD Ultra-Fine II Short Needle Syringes, and a H-TRON-plus V100 insulin pump. Each dose was weighed on an analytical scale, and the delivered and target doses were compared. Accuracy was defined by the absolute percent difference from the target dose. Precision was defined as the absolute percent difference from the group sample mean. Overall, we found that the pen and pump devices were more accurate, and the pump more precise, than the syringes at the 1- and 2-unit doses. Syringes were dangerously inaccurate, clinically, at the 1-unit dose. The use of pens and syringes with very fine increment markings (1/2 unit) did not improve accuracy or precision. Earlier researchers used multiple individuals to draw and weigh the samples. In an effort to eliminate the potential introduction of significant error; our study used only 2 investigators: 1 to draw up the doses and another to weigh them. The conclusions in our study were similar to prior studies.

Insulin pump therapy in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus: results of the Nationwide Quality Circle in Germany (ASD) 1999-2000.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14614650/),"
Only a few specialised centres in Germany initiated insulin pump therapy before 1990. Initiation of pump therapy involves the participation in a structured treatment and teaching programme (TTP). During the last decade insulin pump therapy has been widely used. The impact of this decentralisation on the quality of care is still unknown. The aim of this trial was both to evaluate the outcome of insulin pump therapy outside specialised centres and to identify features that might be associated with persistently increased HbA1 c levels.
250 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (age 36.0 +/- 13.1 years; diabetes duration 16.1 +/- 9.9 years), who were on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy during 1999 - 2000, were individually included in the study. Second examination was performed one year after participation in the in-patient TTP for insulin pump therapy. Patients were recruited from 21 member institutions of the Working Group for Structured Diabetes Therapy of the German Diabetes Association. Further details were sought by questionnaire on those patients with persistently increased HbA1c (> 1.7 fold of mean normal range.)
One year after participation in the TTP for CSII relative HbA1c (original value/mean normal of the local method [Müller et al., 1999]) decreased from 1.51 (0.9 - 3.2) to 1.44 (0.9 - 3.6) (p < 0.0001), severe hypoglycaemia from 0.46 to 0.12/patient/year (p < 0.001), severe ketoacidosis from 0.08 to 0.05/patients/year (p = 0.003) and hospitalisation from 5.2 to 3.1 days/patient/year (p = 0.002). In 43/207 (17%) the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was unchanged (before 0.12 and after TTP 0.14/patients/year), there was slight increase in severe ketoacidosis (before 0.15; after TTP 0.23/patients/year) and hospitalisation days were unchanged (before 4.5; after TTP 4.4 days/patients/year). The following factors were associated with adverse outcomes: psychological problems including eating disorders and alcohol abuse (28%), lack of interest in self-management (28%) and social problems (11%). In 28% there was no follow-up treatment by diabetologists specialised in pump therapy.
The benefits of insulin pump therapy are improvement of HbA1c, reduction of hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis and hospitalisation days as well as improved flexibility. It is possible to draw up a list of clinical criteria and service requirements, which are likely to reduce failures.

Analysis of outcome of pregnancy in type 1 diabetics treated with insulin pump or conventional insulin therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14605971/),"
We evaluated the outcome of pregnancies followed between 1990 and 2000 in 93 women with type 1 diabetes, treated with conventional intensive insulin therapy (n=68) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (n=25). We evaluated metabolic control (fasting and 1-hour post-prandial plasma glucose and HbA1c levels), spontaneous or induced abortions, time and mode of delivery, maternal outcome (pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, placental insufficiency, hydramnios, hypoglycemic coma, ketoacidosis) and fetal outcome (weight, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, fetal distress, asphyxia, hyaline membrane disease, polycythemia, shoulder dystocia, malformations). Patients treated with insulin pump more frequently had background retinopathy and clinical neuropathy. No significant differences were observed between the two groups in metabolic control and maternal outcome. Glycemic control, non-optimal in the prepregnancy state, improved significantly during pregnancy, as shown by the progressive reduction in HbA1c levels. As regards fetal outcome, no differences were observed between the two groups in morbidity and especially in malformation rate. Patients with malformed babies did not have optimal metabolic control at conception. Thus, maternal and perinatal outcomes were comparable in patients treated with insulin pump and continuous subcutaneous insulin therapy, and depended on metabolic control. In patients in higher White's class and with more unstable glycemia, we achieved metabolic control and outcomes comparable with those of women of lower White's class and more stable glycemic values using the insulin pump. Our data suggest that insulin pump therapy is useful in problematic, complicated cases of women who want a baby.

To compare the efficacy and feasibility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) in children with type 1 diabetes.
The study sample included 23 children (10 males) aged 9.4 to 13.9 years with type 1 diabetes. An open randomized crossover design was used to compare 3.5 months of CSII to 3.5 months of MDI therapy for the following variables: diabetic control, incidence of adverse events, daily insulin requirement, body mass index standard deviation scores, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life.
The changes in HbA(1c) and fructoseamine values were similar in the 2 arms over time. At the end of the study, mean HbA(1c) level measured 8.05 +/- 0.78%. There were no differences between the treatment modes in frequency of symptomatic hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic events. There was 1 event of severe hypoglycemia during pump therapy and 3 during MDI, yielding a rate of 0.26 events per patient-year. There were no episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis. Body mass index standard deviation scores decreased during CSII and increased during MDI, as did mean insulin dose. Patients expressed a higher treatment satisfaction from CSII than MDI, although there was no difference in quality of life between the 2 modes.
Intensive insulin therapy by either insulin pump or MDI is safe in children and young adolescents with type 1 diabetes, with similar diabetes control and a very low rate of adverse events. We suggest that both modes be available to the diabetic team to better tailor therapy.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in patients with diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12918949/),"
During the last quarter of a century continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with external portable insulin pumps has been increasingly used in selected type 1 diabetic subjects and also in some patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The treatment of diabetes mellitus with insulin pumps has become more and more popular and accepted by diabetic patients as well as by medical professionals worldwide. Published trials have shown that, in most patients, mean blood glucose concentration and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) percentages are either slightly lower or similar on CSII versus an optimized therapy with multiple daily insulin injections. Hypoglycemic episodes seem to be less frequent and ketoacidoses occur at a comparable rate to that during intensive injection therapy. Moreover, nocturnal glycemic control can be improved with insulin pumps, and automatic basal rate changes help to minimize a prebreakfast blood glucose increase (often called 'the dawn phenomenon'). For many patients, CSII provides greater flexibility in timing of meals with the result of better quality of life and higher treatment satisfaction. However, despite these promising data, and although many patients with diabetes mellitus with well-defined clinical problems are likely to benefit substantially from CSII, either in respect to glycemic control, acute complications or quality of life and treatment satisfaction, we are still far away from reaching'dream diabetes management', the fully automatic closed-loop system. Presently, the most difficult problem concerns not the design of an 'optimal' insulin pump, but rather the development of a system which is able to provide continuous and reliable blood glucose monitoring. Hence, because this problem has not been solved with maximum satisfaction, the development of a feedback-controlled 'artificial pancreas' is one of the main goals in diabetes management in the new millennium.

A novel use of U-500 insulin for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in patients with insulin resistance: a case series.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12917058/),"
To report our experience with use of U-500 regular insulin (U-500) for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in four patients with type 2 diabetes requiring high-dose insulin.
We performed a retrospective review of medical records of four patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance who were using U-500 in a CSII regimen for at least 6 months. Before treatment conversion, two patients were receiving CSII with use of insulin lispro, and two were receiving multiple daily insulin injections. Clinical assessment was monitored with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Changes in the insulin volume administered and associated cost savings are analyzed.
Three months after conversion to U-500 therapy, the average HbA1c decreased from 10.8% to 7.6%. By 6 months, it declined further to 7.3%. With use of U-500, the absolute volume of insulin infused per day decreased by at least fourfold. This volume reduction led to potential cost savings for insulin of up to $2,600 per year per patient and a savings for pump supplies of up to $3,400 per year per patient. All patients had subjective improvement in quality of life.
We propose that smaller volumes of insulin with use of U-500 allow for more efficient absorption of large doses of insulin and yield improved glycemic control. In our four patients, the use of U-500 for CSII resulted in improved quality of life, cost savings for treatment, and potential reduction in diabetes-related complications based on the decline in HbA1c. This treatment method may be a novel alternative for patients with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance who have not met goal glycemic control with standard intensive regimens or who require insulin doses exceeding current insulin pump delivery capacity.

Intensive insulin therapy is a method of choice in the management of patients with type 1 diabetes. Its administration in the youngest children is limited by little or no acceptance of multiple injections and a typical fear of needles and syringes. In recent years more and more frequently the method of multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin is being replaced by the method of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) even in the youngest children.
Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of CSII method in children at prepubertal age.
There were 61 children under 10 years of age with type 1 diabetes recruited for the study (33 boys, 28 girls). CSII method was implemented for the period of minimum 6 months. In the group of 21 children CSII method was the first method of their therapy (it was administered at the time of diagnosis). Mean duration of diabetes was 3.0 years +/-1.87 year, mean age at diagnosis was 3.82+/-2.19 years and mean duration of CSII treatment was 1.4 +/-0.75 year. The average HbA1c at the baseline for all children was 8.7+/-1.4%.
In the group where CSII therapy was implemented as the first method of management, mean duration of treatment was 1.5 years, mean HbA1c decreased after first 3 months from 9.6+/-1.68% to 7.22+/-0.99% (p<0.05). After 12 and 24 months the value further decreased to 7.01+/-0.57%. In the group that was earlier treated with MDI method (n=40), mean value of HbA1c decreased after 3 months from 8.27+/-1.4% to 7.6 +/-0.86% (p<0.05), after 12 months it further decreased to 7.37+/-0.86%, after 24 months its mean value was 7.53%. The number of patients with HbA1c >8% decreased from 58.4% to 10%. Adverse events were observed only in the group that was earlier treated with the MDI method. There were 3 incidences of severe hypoglycaemia, 2 incidences of diabetic ketoacidosis, 2 incidences of infection at the needle site (in one case the surgical attention was necessary). After two years of the trial there was a statistically significant difference in the mean value of HbA1c between children that used CSII method from the moment of their diagnosis (HbA1c=7.01%) and those who were earlier treated with MDI method (HbA1c=7.53 +/-0.73%). In both groups the daily insulin requirement was similar (CSII method 0.69+/-0.2 unit/kg/day, MDI method 0.75+/-0.19 unit/kg/day).
The method of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) provides good and sustained metabolic control in the youngest children with type 1 diabetes. Administering of that method from the very beginning of the diabetes treatment may decrease the risk of acute complications.

The cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared with multiple daily injections for the management of diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12823242/),"
To estimate the cost effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) compared with multiple daily injections (MDI) for patients using insulin pumps.
We constructed a Markov model to estimate the costs and outcomes for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes (IDDM) treated with CSII using an insulin pump compared with MDI. Key parameters were obtained from the published scientific literature. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Monte Carlo simulations were undertaken for 10 000 hypothetical patients over 8 years of monthly cycles (the expected life of a pump).
Over an 8-year period an average patient could expect to gain 0.48 [standard deviation (sd) 0.20] QALYs using CSII compared with MDI. The additional cost over 8 years for this gain was pounds 5462 (sd pounds 897). The incremental cost per QALY was pounds 11,461 (sd pounds 3656). CSII was most cost-effective in patients who had more than two severe hypoglycaemic events per year and who required admission to hospital at least once every year. Cases where CSII might be not economically viable are cases where diabetes is well controlled with few severe hypoglycaemic events. Results were most sensitive to the number of hypoglycaemic events per patient and the utility weights used to estimate QALYs.
CSII is a worthwhile investment when targeted to those who might benefit most.

[Insulin therapy by insulin pump: continuous or conventional self-blood glucose monitoring? ].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12746628/),"
Use of portable pumps is increasing to achieve intensive insulin treatment. Beside unpredictable insulin absorption and insufficient reactivity to changes of insulin flow rate due to the subcutaneous route, this therapy is however limited by the lack of information on blood glucose level provided by self-blood glucose monitoring. Thus, patient interpretation only leads to speculative adaptation of pump flow rate. The lack of alert toward the risk of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemic ketogenic deviations can lead to the occurrence of deleterious metabolic distorsions, among which severe hypoglycemia stands in first rank. Starting experiences of continuous recording of interstitial glucose level by portable systems using glucose-oxidase allow on short time durations the identification of daily periods of poor metabolic control. Retrospective availability of information gives the possibility of more adequate treatment adaptations than conventional capillary blood glucose monitoring, but does not allow immediate prevention of metabolic events. Only devices providing real time or near-real time information to the patient can fulfill this function. However, the absence of tight parallelism between variations of interstitial and blood glucose levels may lead to erroneous decisions. A true continuous real time information on blood glucose level on long-term seems only expectable from implantable glucose sensors. Still under investigation, these systems should be able to insure vigilance toward the risk of hypo- and hyperglycemia on weekly or monthly periods. Initially used as complementary to capillary self-monitoring, their reliability should allow their use as substitutes for conventional monitoring, except for measurements aimed at signal calibration. Pump control by the sensor signal is conceivable if it corresponds to a direct, continuous, real time measurement of blood glucose, and subject to a simultaneous improvement of insulin infusion modes.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in children and adolescents with diabetes mellitus: decreased HbA1c with low risk of hypoglycemia.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12705364/),"
To evaluate blood glucose and HbA1c levels, insulin dosage, hypoglycemia rate and body mass index (BMI) at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after initiation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in children and youth with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM).
A 6-month trial of pump therapy was carried out in 40 patients with type 1 DM and one with cystic fibrosis (CF) induced DM (25 males), aged 4-25 years (mean 13.5 +/- 4.2 [SD]; 4-8 years, n = 6; 8-10 years, n = 8; 10-12 years, n = 4; 12-15 years, n = 11; >15 years, n = 12).
HbA1c was significantly reduced from 9.5 +/- 1.7% to 8.6 +/- 1.2% at 3 months (p < 0.03), and at 6 months 8.8 +/- 1.5% (p < 0.05). The mean daily values of blood glucose, as well as individual mean values of blood glucose at fasting and before lunch, also exhibited a significant reduction (p < 0.05) at 3 and 6 months. There was a significant reduction in the number of hypoglycemic events (level of plasma glucose <3.3 mmol/l, calculated as number of events per patient/30 days) at 3 months (6.5 +/- 5.5 vs 2.8 +/- 3.3; p = 0.02) and at 6 months (6.5 +/- 5.5 vs 3.5 +/- 3.0; p = 0.04). The insulin requirement dropped by 27.2% (1.03 +/- 0.30 U/kg/day before starting CSII; 0.75 +/- 020 U/kg/day on insulin pump therapy onset; 0.76 +/- 0.18 U/kg/day at 3 months; 0.75 +/- 0.21 U/kg/day at 6 months). During the follow-up 0.10 events of diabetic ketoacidosis/patient/year were recorded. The patients exhibited no increase in BMI during the 6 months of follow-up.

Safety and effectiveness of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12663587/),"
To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of insulin pump therapy in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.
All 95 patients who began insulin pump therapy at Johns Hopkins Hospital between January 1990 and December 2000 were included in the study. The mean age was 12.0 years (range 4-18), and 29% of the patients were <10 years old. Data were obtained by chart review beginning 6-12 months before pump start. The median duration of follow-up was 28 months.
There was a small but significant decrease in HbA(1c) at 3-6 months after pump start (7.7 vs. 7.5%; P = 0.03). HbA(1c) levels then gradually increased and remained elevated after 1 year of follow-up; however, this association was confounded by age and diabetes duration, both of which were associated with higher HbA(1c) levels. After adjusting for duration and age, mean HbA(1c) after pump start was significantly lower than before pump start (7.7 vs. 8.1%; P < 0.001). The number of medical complications (diabetic ketoacidosis, emergency department visits) was similar before and after pump start. There were fewer hypoglycemic events after pump start (12 vs. 17, rate ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.21-1.01).
This study suggests that pump therapy is safe and effective in selected children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

To conduct a meta-analysis of the metabolic and psychosocial impact of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy on adults, adolescents, and children.
Studies were identified and data regarding study design, year of publication, sample size, patient's age, diabetes duration, and duration of CSII therapy were collected. Means and SDs for glycohemoglobin, blood glucose, insulin dosages, and body weight for CSII and comparison conditions were subjected to meta-analytic procedures. Data regarding pump complications and psychosocial functioning were reviewed descriptively.
A total of 52 studies, consisting of 1,547 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. Results indicate that CSII therapy is associated with significant improvements in glycemic control (decreased glycohemoglobin and mean blood glucose). A descriptive review of potential complications of CSII use (e.g., hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA], pump malfunction, and site infections) suggests a decreased frequency of hypoglycemic episodes but an increased frequency of DKA in studies published before 1993.
CSII therapy is associated with improved glycemic control compared with traditional insulin therapies (conventional therapy and multiple daily injections) and does not appear to be associated with significant adverse outcomes. Additional studies are needed to further examine the relative risks of CSII therapy, including the potential psychosocial impact of this technologically advanced therapy.

Preliminary investigations of intravascular enzymatic sensors demonstrate their clinical acceptability and accuracy and the possibility of developing closed-loop insulin delivery by combination with implantable pumps.

Reduction of blood glucose variability in type 1 diabetic patients treated by pancreatic islet transplantation: interest of continuous glucose monitoring.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12453970/),"
To compare the glycemic profiles of patients with type 1 diabetes treated with either an implantable insulin pump or pancreas or islet transplantation by the means of the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS; Minimed, Sylmar, CA).
The CGMS enabled recording of subcutaneous glucose concentrations (range 2.2-22 mmol/l) over 72 h (288 measurements per day). Over 3 days, 26 patients with type 1 diabetes were connected to a CGMS: 10 patients were treated with intraperitoneal insulin infusion through an implantable pump (IPII), 9 patients were treated with simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation (SPK), and 7 patients were treated with pancreatic islet transplantation after kidney grafting (IAK). All SPK patients and four IAK patients were insulin independent, whereas three IAK patients had partial graft function and reduced exogenous insulin needs. Glucose control was evaluated by the mean glucose concentration, glucose variability, and the number and duration of hypoglycemic events (<3.3 mmol/l) over 3 days.
The mean glucose concentration and the glucose variability in SPK and IAK patients were significantly lower than those observed in patients treated with IPII: 5.38 +/- 1.12 and 5.83 +/- 0.81 vs. 7.81 +/- 1.55 mmol/l (P < 0.001) and 1.40 +/- 0.42 and 1.32 +/- 0.53 vs. 3.47 +/- 1.66 mmol/l (P < 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, the mean glucose concentration and the glucose variability were comparable between SPK and IAK patients. Over 3 days, no hypoglycemic events were observed in SPK patients and insulin-independent IAK patients. A total of 4.12 +/- 1.66 hypoglycemic events were detected in the IPII patient group, whereas only 0.66 +/- 0.57 events were observed in IAK patients with partial graft function (P < 0.001). The duration of the hypoglycemic events was significantly longer in IPII patients as compared with IAK patients: 64 +/- 33 vs. 30 +/- 15 min for the day period and 130 +/- 62 vs. 30 +/- 27 min for the night period (P < 0.001).
Use of subcutaneous CGMS confirms that islet transplantation can be as efficient as pancreas transplantation in restoring good metabolic control and reducing blood glucose variability. Metabolic improvement due to use of an implantable insulin pump requires insulin delivery by a closed loop.

"[From external to implantable insulin pump, can we close the loop?].",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12442060/),"
The project to finalize a 'closed loop' insulin delivery according to blood glucose level, i.e. an implanted artificial beta cell, is born from the development of the first miniaturized portable insulin pumps during the 1970s. Continuous improvements in micro-electronics, as well as in the development of biomaterials and stable insulin solutions, have led to the availability of implantable pumps able to infuse insulin by the peritoneal route, in a continuous and programmable way, for several years. These systems represent the most efficient and physiological mode of insulin therapy at the present time. More recently, we have demonstrated during clinical trials that intravascular, implantable, glucose sensors using glucose-oxidase were able to measure with good accuracy real-time blood glucose for several months. The combination of these two devices to form a prototype of implantable artificial beta cell, designated as Long Term Sensor System, allowed us to perform the first trials of closed-loop insulin delivery according to sensor signal for periods of 48 hours in type 1 diabetic patients. This mode of functioning appeared to be feasible and able to establish glucose control closer to physiology than the use of implantable pumps in open-loop, i.e. by adapting insulin delivery according to capillary blood glucose. Although algorithms tuning automated insulin delivery are improvable, the success of these initial trials materializes the perspective of a possible restoration of physiological insulin function by the mean of an implanted artificial beta cell in diabetic patients.

To assess in a randomized crossover trial the efficacy of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in improving glycemic control and health-related quality of life in type 1 diabetic patients with long-standing poor glycemic control.
A total of 79 patients in 11 Dutch centers were randomized to 16 weeks of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion followed by 16 weeks intensive injection therapy or the reverse order. Glycemic control was assessed by HbA(1c), self-reported hypoglycemic events, and blood glucose memory meter read outs. Changes in quality of life were assessed by self-report questionnaires administered at baseline and 16 weeks.
As the drop-out rate after crossover was high (17 of 79 patients [22%]), we analyzed the trial as a parallel clinical trial, using data of the first half of the crossover phase only. At 16 weeks, mean HbA(1c) was 0.84% (95% CI -1.31 to -0.36) lower in the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion group compared with the insulin injection group (P = 0.002). Stability of blood glucose self-measurement values, expressed as SD of the nine-point blood glucose profiles, improved in the insulin pump group by 29.3 +/- 41.1 vs. 8.2 +/- 36.5% in the injection group (P = 0.039). The number of mild hypoglycemic episodes per patient-week was 0.99 (95% CI 0.11-1.87) higher in the insulin pump group (P = 0.028). Weight gain was similar in both groups. Scores on the Short-Form 36-Item subscales 'general health' and 'mental health' improved in the continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion group, compared with stable values in the injection group (P = 0.048 and 0.050, respectively).

To test whether glycemic control in young children could be achieved more effectively and safely by using continuous insulin infusions administered by insulin pumps.
We analyzed the effects of pump therapy in nine toddlers in whom type 1 diabetes developed between the ages of 10 and 40 months. After a mean of 13.7 months of therapy with multiple daily injections, patients were treated with insulin pumps for periods ranging from 7 to 19 months (mean, 12.7 months).
Before initiation of pump therapy, HbA1c levels averaged 9.5% +/- 0.4%, and patients had a mean of 0.52 episodes per month of severe hypoglycemia (uncontrolled shaking, inconsolable crying, disorientation, or seizures). After initiation of pump therapy, HbA1c levels declined to 7.9% +/- 0.3% (P <.001 vs prepump levels), and the incidence of severe hypoglycemia decreased to 0.09 episodes per month (P <.05). Normal linear growth and weight gain were maintained during pump therapy. There were no changes in the frequency of physician or emergency room visits for acute hyperglycemia or ketoacidosis. However, the frequency of parental contacts with health personnel declined by >80%, reflecting increasing parental confidence and independence in diabetic care. Subjective assessments revealed significant improvements in quality of life and high levels of satisfaction with pump therapy.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with a portable insulin pump has been used for several years in the treatment of adult patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). This treatment, however, has rarely been utilised in children and adolescents. We studied the use of CSII in 16 children and adolescents with type 1 DM at Tampere and Kuopio University Hospitals between 1992 and 1997. The longest treatment periods are more than 4 years. The reasons for switching to CSII treatment and the goals achieved were evaluated. Glycaemic control before and during CSII treatment and the occurrence of hypoglycaemia and ketoacidosis were analysed. Compared with conventional insulin treatment, improved glycaemic control and a reduced frequency of hypoglycaemic events were achieved with CSII in those with particularly poor initial metabolic control (HbA1c >10.0%). The overall satisfaction with pump therapy was high in both patients and their families. According to our experience, CSII may be of benefit, especially in young infants with type 1 DM, but also in affected adolescents with unacceptable glycaemic control.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has become increasingly popular as a form of intensified insulin therapy in adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). One reported drawback was increased weight gain in adolescents after initiation of insulin pump therapy. In a prospective, longitudinal, non-randomized and case controlled study, we followed 12 adolescents (mean age 13.6 yr, 8 males, 4 females) from 6 months before the start of CSII to 12 months on CSII. These 12 adolescents with DM on CSII were matched for age, gender, HbA1c, duration of DM, and body mass index (BMI) with 12 adolescents who continued on multiple injection therapy (MIT). In addition, six of the 12 adolescents on CSII intended to control their weight by means of the insulin pump. These six vs six adolescents within the CSII group were further analyzed for weight development and eating habits. Clinical indications for CSII were dawn phenomenon, night-time hypoglycemia and patient request for more flexibility in DM management. All patients had been in satisfactory metabolic control on MIT. After 12 months of CSII, the daily insulin requirement remained significantly lower than 18 months before (0.79 +/- 0.11 vs 1.02 +/- 27 U/kg/d, p = 0.034) and number of daily meals was lower (4.1 +/- 0.9 vs 6.5 +/- 0.7, p = 0.006). Mean initial HbA1c was 7.4% in the MIT and CSII patients, and remained comparable between these two groups. BMI was not different between the CSII and MIT group over the entire study period. However, those adolescents on CSII who intended to control their weight by means of the insulin pump were able to achieve relative weight loss during the,first 6 months on CSII. Two patients of the CSII group had one severe hypoglycemic episode with loss of consciousness. In conclusion, CSII does not lead to weight gain by itself, but allows sufficient weight control without a negative effect on metabolic control. The general threat of weight gain in patients who switch to insulin pump therapy must be pointed out, and the role of eating habits and caloric content of food should play a central role in insulin pump educational programs.

Selection for and initiation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. Proceedings from a workshop.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11979036/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) has been used in the paediatric age group for more than 20 years. The technique is not yet widely used in most countries but there has recently been increasing interest in pump therapy for young children and adolescents. In 1999, 7.5% of Swedish children and adolescents with diabetes used pumps, now the figure is approaching 12%. The indication for starting pump therapy has usually been a medical problem, but today quality of life issues are becoming increasingly important. One technique sometimes used is to start CSII by wearing the pump only at night. Daily insulin requirements are usually decreased compared with injection therapy. Studies have shown that it is possible to lower HbA1c when using an insulin pump and that the risk of severe hypoglycaemia can be lowered. The use of CSII has also been successful in preventing recurrent admission for diabetic ketoacidosis. While starting pump therapy does take an extra effort from both the diabetes team and the family, routine visits are generally no more time-consuming than for patients on multiple injection therapy. CSII can be initiated during admission to hospital but most pumps are started on an outpatient basis. Our department has the patients on the day care ward for 3-4 days of 'pump school'. Parents wear a saline pump for practice. The total daily insulin dose is usually lowered 15-20% compared with multiple injections; on average 40-50% (sometimes up to 60%) of the daily dose is given as basal rate. We start all pumps on rapid-acting analogues and use 40 IU/ml if the basal rate is <0.3 IU/h. In conclusion, the use of CSII in children and adolescents is well accepted and can be managed safely.

Diabetes management in the new millennium using insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11921425/),"
Current goals of therapy of type 1 and 2 diabetes are to achieve near normal glycemia, minimize the risk of severe hypoglycemia, limit excessive weight gain, improve quality of life and delay or prevent late vascular complications. As discussed in this review, insulin pump or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy provides a treatment option that can dramatically aid in achieving all of these goals. In comparison to multiple daily injections (MDI), CSII uses only rapid-acting insulin, provides greater flexibility in timing of meals and snacks, has programmable basal rates to optimize overnight glycemic control, can reduce the risk of exercise-induced hypoglycemia, and enhances patients' ability to control their own diabetes. Most important, in adults and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, CSII has been shown to lower HbA(1c) levels, reduce the frequency of severe hypoglycemia and limit excessive weight gain versus MDI without increasing the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis. Similarly positive results are being seen with CSII in adults with type 2 diabetes. The effectiveness of CSII and improvements in pump technology have fueled a dramatic increase in the use of this therapy. Practical guidelines are presented for selection of patients, initiation of treatment, patient education, follow-up assessments and troubleshooting. The recent introduction of methods for continuous glucose monitoring provides a new means to optimize the basal and bolus capabilities of CSII and offers the hope of the development of a feedback-controlled artificial pancreas.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion at 25 years: evidence base for the expanding use of insulin pump therapy in type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11874953/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) is used in selected type 1 diabetic subjects to achieve strict blood glucose control. A quarter of a century after its introduction, world-wide use of CSII is increasing. We review the evidence base that justifies this increase, including effectiveness compared with modern intensified insulin injection regimens and concern about possible complications. Review of controlled trials shows that, in most patients, mean blood glucose concentrations and glycated hemoglobin percentages are either slightly lower or similar on CSII versus multiple insulin injections. However, hypoglycemia is markedly less frequent than during intensive injection therapy. Ketoacidosis occurs at the same rate. Nocturnal glycemic control is improved with insulin pumps, and automatic basal rate changes help to minimize a prebreakfast blood glucose increase (the ""dawn phenomenon"") often seen with injection therapy. Patients with ""brittle"" diabetes characterized by recurrent ketoacidosis are often not improved by CSII, although there may be exceptions. We argue that explicit clinical indications for CSII are helpful; we suggest the principal indications for health service or health insurance-funded CSII should include frequent, unpredictable hypoglycemia or a marked dawn phenomenon, which persist after attempts to improve control with intensive insulin injection regimens. In any circumstances, candidates for CSII must be motivated, willing and able to undertake pump therapy, and adequately psychologically stable. Some diabetic patients with well-defined clinical problems are likely to benefit substantially from CSII and should not be denied a trial of the treatment. Their number is relatively small, as would therefore be the demand on funds set aside for this purpose.

To describe the use of insulin pump therapy in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or type 2 diabetes in pregnancy and persistent hyperglycemia despite multiple injections of subcutaneous insulin.
As part of a service audit, deliveries to women with diabetes at a single South Auckland hospital were reviewed from 1991 through 1994. Glycemic control was estimated by the mean of self-recorded and laboratory postprandial glucose concentrations. In a nested case-control study, pregnancies complicated by GDM/type 2 diabetes with use of an insulin pump were compared with those without insulin pump therapy and peak insulin requirements of 100-199 units/ day, matched for ethnicity and type of diabetes.
A total of 30 of 251 Polynesian, European, and South Asian women with singleton pregnancies complicated by insulin-requiring GDM/type 2 diabetes used an insulin pump. An additional two women with high insulin requirements discontinued pump therapy. None of the women with GDM/type 2 diabetes experienced severe hypoglycemia, whereas 79% of the women had improved glycemic control within 1-4 weeks. Mothers using a pump had greater insulin requirements (median maximum 246 vs. 130 units per day) and greater weight gain (10.6 vs. 5.0 kg). Their babies were more likely to be admitted to the Special Care Baby Unit but were neither significantly heavier nor experienced greater hypoglycemia than control subjects.

This study compared glycemic control achieved with insulin lispro or buffered regular human insulin in patients with Type 1 diabetes treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using an external insulin pump. In this 24-week multicenter, randomized, two-way crossover, open-label trial, 58 patients on CSII with adequate glycemic control received either insulin lispro or buffered regular human insulin for 12 weeks, followed by the alternate treatment for another 12 weeks. Efficacy and safety measures included hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) at baseline and endpoint, home blood glucose monitoring, hypoglycemia, and frequency of pump catheter occlusion. Patients consumed a standard test meal on three occasions, with determinations of fasting, 1- and 2-h postprandial glucose values. Insulin lispro use was associated with a significantly lower HbA(1c) than was buffered regular human insulin (7.41+/-0.97 vs. 7.65+/-0.85 mmol/l; P=.004). Fasting serum glucose values before the test meal were similar between the two therapies. The 1-h (11.16+/-4.29 vs. 13.20+/-4.68 mmol/l; P=.012) and 2-h (9.64+/-4.10 vs. 12.53+/-4.64 mmol/l; P=.001) postprandial glucose concentrations were significantly lower during treatment with insulin lispro. No differences between treatments were observed in basal or bolus insulin doses, weight gain, or the incidence and rate of hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or pump occlusions. When used in external pumps, insulin lispro provides better glycemic control than buffered regular human insulin with a similar adverse event profile.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion: a comprehensive review of insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11606144/),"
A tremendous amount of data suggest that near-normal glycemic control prevents or delays complications of diabetes, which has led to a dramatic increase in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) or insulin pump use. In this article, the data supporting CSII in type 1 diabetes is reviewed, and the advantages and disadvantages of CSII are analyzed. In addition, CSII use in specific situations is examined, including during childhood and pregnancy and while exercising. The published articles suggest that CSII provides better glycemic control than does conventional therapy and comparable to or slightly better control than multiple daily injections. The use of CSII may be especially indicated during pregnancy or for preconception care and for diabetes presenting in childhood or adolescence.

Beneficial effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in older patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11585372/),"
To assess the effect of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) on glycemic control, hypoglycemia, and daily insulin requirements in five older patients with long-standing type 1 diabetes previously treated with multiple-dose insulin injections (MDII).
We undertook a retrospective analysis of five older patients (three women and two men) with type 1 diabetes and a mean age of 66.4 years (range, 57 to 76). The mean duration of disease was 33 years (range, 18 to 49), and all patients had suboptimal glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin or HbA(1c) >8.0%), presence of microvascular complications, and unacceptably frequent hypoglycemia during MDII therapy. A diabetes care team monitored their clinical course after their treatment was changed to a CSII regimen. Data pertaining to HbA(1c), severe hypoglycemia, and insulin dose before and after conversion to CSII were compared with use of paired t tests.
After initiation of CSII therapy, the mean HbA(1c) value decreased from 9.16% to 7.6% (P<0.0025), the rate of severe hypoglycemia decreased from 3.2 episodes to 0.4 episode per year (P<0.02), and the mean total daily insulin dose was reduced from 44.9 IU to 32.4 IU (P<0.05) during a mean duration of 12.6 months of CSII therapy.
Insulin pump therapy can prove highly beneficial in older patients with type 1 diabetes by improving glycemic control, reducing hypoglycemic episodes and insulin dosage, and possibly increasing treatment satisfaction. These changes can potentially prevent morbidity and prove to be cost-effective. For implementation of pump conversion to be safe and successful, careful patient selection, proper education, and ongoing support through a comprehensive diabetes education and management program are imperative. Future reports of experience with CSII in elderly patients should help to elucidate its promising advantages in this patient population and provide guidelines for use.

A randomized study comparing blood glucose control and risk of severe hypoglycemia achieved by non-programmable versus programmable external insulin pumps.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11431597/),"
To compare a non-programmable and a programmable insulin external pump using regular insulin on glycemic stability, the risk of severe hypoglycemia and metabolic control in type 1 diabetic patients.
Ten type 1 diabetic patients were involved in a randomized, crossover study comparing two periods of 3 months with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) either with a non-programmable insulin pump or a programmable insulin pump. Comparisons were made among mean blood glucose values before and after meals, at bedtime and at 2: 00 a.m.; the risk of severe hypoglycemia assessed by the low blood glucose index (LBGI); and HbA1c.
Mean average blood glucose (BG) measurements were significantly lower with the programmable in comparison with the non-programmable insulin pump (respectively 157+/-78 vs. 165+/-79, p=0.034). While postprandial values for BG were not different between the two pumps, the use of the programmable pump resulted in a significant decrease in mean preprandial BG levels (140+/-68 vs. 150+/-73 mg/dl p=0.039). Conversely mean BG level was lower at 2 a.m. with the non-prgrammable pump (125+/-81 vs. 134 +/-93 mg/dl, p=0.02) but with a higher incidence of hypoglycemia. Mean LBGI was comparable with the two pumps (3.1+/-8.6 vs. 2.8+/-6.9, p=0.1). There was a 0.2% decrease in HbA1c during the programmable pump period that did not reach statistical significance (p=0.37).
The present study suggests that programmable external insulin pumps, although more complex and more expensive than non-programmable insulin pumps, significantly reduce fasting glycemia during the day without increasing the risk of severe hypoglycemia and are safer during the night.

Efficacy of insulin pump therapy: mealtime delivery is the key factor.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11421538/),"
To investigate, in a clinical setting, the effect of implementation of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) on control of plasma glucose and to identify factors associated with improved glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.
Nineteen patients (16 women and 3 men) with type 1 diabetes were studied retrospectively. Their mean age was 42.6 years (range, 30 to 58), and the mean duration of diabetes was 21 years. The subjects underwent follow-up for a mean of 14 months after conversion to CSII therapy. With use of paired t tests, pre-CSII and follow-up data were evaluated relative to changes in weight, insulin dosing, and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)).
At follow-up, the total daily dose of insulin had decreased by 18%, from a baseline mean value of 45.2 IU to 37.1 IU (P = 0.02). HbA(1c) was reduced from 8.4% to 7.7% (P<0.01). The total daily insulin-to-weight ratio also significantly decreased from 0.66 IU/kg to 0.53 IU/kg (P<0.05). Before insulin pump use, the regular/NPH insulin ratio was 0.5 IU; at follow-up, the pump bolus/basal insulin ratio was 1.0 IU (P = 0.02). No weight gain was observed; the mean weight of the study patients decreased 0.2 kg, from 69.4 kg at baseline to 69.2 kg at follow-up (not significantly different).
In a clinical setting, CSII therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes improves glycemic control and lowers the total daily basal insulin dose without affecting weight. Improved glycemic control was associated with a shift in insulin therapy from a high percentage of intermediate-acting insulin to a greater percentage of insulin administered in a meal-associated bolus form. This study emphasizes the importance of mealtime insulin adjustment for tight glycemic control in patients using CSII therapy. Future studies evaluating the benefits of decreased total insulin and an increased bolus/basal insulin ratio may be important in helping to understand how to avoid long-term complications of diabetes.

Basal insulin replacement and use of rapid-acting insulin analogues in patients with type 1 diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11419927/),"
To analyze various treatment strategies for replacement of basal insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes who are receiving rapid-acting insulin with meals.
Recently published studies are reviewed, and the available information on basal insulin adjustment is summarized.
In a comparison of presupper insulin lispro versus regular human insulin in adolescent patients, postprandial blood glucose excursion was much lower with insulin lispro. Patients who were given regular insulin at supper and no bedtime snack had a significantly higher occurrence of nocturnal hypoglycemia than did those given insulin lispro at supper and no snack at bedtime. In another study that attempted to identify the optimal basal insulin in the context of multidose therapy with insulin lispro, NPH insulin yielded lower blood glucose levels and a trend toward better glycosylated hemoglobin levels than did Ultralente insulin. For improvement of glycemic control during insulin lispro therapy, adjustments in the ratio of bolus to basal insulin and the number of basal insulin injections have been shown to be useful. In addition, use of insulin lispro in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy significantly reduced the rate of occurrence of hypoglycemic episodes in comparison with regular insulin.
Rapid-acting insulin analogues improve postprandial blood glucose control and decrease the frequency of hypoglycemia in patients with type 1 diabetes whether insulin pump therapy or a multidose insulin injection regimen is being used. For full benefit of short-acting insulin analogues, adjustments must be made in basal insulin replacement.

Impact of insulin lispro on HbA1c values in insulin pump users.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11225746/),"
To compare the therapeutic efficacy of the short-acting insulin analogue insulin lispro (Humalog) with that of buffered regular human insulin (Velosulin) in patients on insulin pump therapy.
Sixty-two (45 women and 17 men) young patients with type 1 diabetes using insulin pump therapy were compared while using buffered regular human insulin for a mean +/- s.e.m. of 20.1+/-1.2 months or insulin lispro for a mean +/- s.e.m. of 19.7+/-0.5 months. The initial mean +/- s.e.m. age and duration of diabetes were 29.1+/-0.9 and 17.7+/-0.9 years, respectively. The mean HbA1c values, basal insulin dosages, premeal insulin dosages and number of low blood sugars were recorded during treatment with both insulins.
Mean +/- s.e.m. HbA1c values were significantly lower (p < 0.001; paired Wilcoxon t-test) during insulin lispro treatment (7.4+/-0.1%) as compared to treatment with buffered regular human insulin (7.9+/-0.1%). Total units of insulin (mean +/- s.e.m.)/kg/day was significantly (p = 0.03) lower (0.61+/-0.02) during the insulin lispro treatment period as compared to the buffered regular human insulin treated period (0.65+/-0.03). Total mean +/- s.e.m. (U/kg/day) of basal insulin administered per day was higher when patients received insulin lispro treatment (0.44+/-0.02 vs. 0.42+/-0.01 for buffered regular human insulin treated period; p = 0.002). The premeal insulin boluses (mean +/- s.e.m.) for the two treatment groups were significantly different with less insulin required for the insulin lispro treatment period for all three meals (p < 0.001, t-test). The number of mild/moderate and severe hypoglycaemic episodes were similar in the two groups.
We conclude that use of insulin lispro in pump therapy significantly lowers HbA1c values in comparison to therapy with buffered regular human insulin insulin without increasing hypoglycaemic episodes.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for children and adolescents: an option for routine diabetes care.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11158469/),"
The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) (insulin pump) therapy in routine pediatric diabetes care by comparing the HbA(1c), body mass index (BMI), and hypoglycemic episodes before and after initiation of CSII therapy.
Data from 56 patients (7-23 years old) were collected during regularly scheduled visits at a frequency similar to non-CSII patients.
The data were analyzed for the entire cohort and 3 subgroups (decreased, stable, or increased HbA(1c)) stratified according to a >/=0.5% change in HbA(1c). The total cohort demonstrated a decrease in HbA(1c) from 8.5% to 8.3%. The decreased cohort (39.4% of the total cohort) demonstrated a significant decrease in HbA(1c) from 8.6% to 7.6%. The mean HbA(1c) of the stable cohort (41.0%) was 8.7%. The increased cohort (19.6%) had an increase in HbA(1c) from 7.8% to 8.8%. Thirty-six patients (64.3%) maintained or achieved a HbA(1c) <8.0% or achieved a HbA(1c) at least 1% lower than their pre-CSII level. Of concern, 6 patients (10.7%) demonstrated a clinically significant increase in HbA(1c) from 8.3% to 9.6%. For the entire cohort, the rate of severe hypoglycemia before and on CSII therapy was 12.3 and 9.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively. A statistically significant proportion of patients reported a decrease in seizure frequency versus an increase (17.9% vs 1.8%) as well as a decrease in overall hypoglycemic frequency versus an increase (41.1% vs 17.9%). There was not a clinically significant increase in BMI, even in the decreased HbA(1c) cohort.
CSII therapy is an appropriate option for some children in routine pediatric diabetes care. It can effectively decrease the HbA(1c) and reduce hypoglycemic episodes, without producing an abnormal increase in BMI.

Improved glycemic control with use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion compared with multiple insulin injection therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11141585/),"
To compare, in a long-term study, glycemic control by means of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII or insulin pump therapy) versus multiple insulin injection therapy (MIIT) in routine clinical practice.
We identified, from a search of medical records, all active patients (N = 90) receiving CSII who had previously received MIIT. The primary objective was to compare the mean glycemic control, as documented by frequent measurements of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)), during the 3-year period before initiation of CSII versus the mean glycemic control during the 3-year period after the first year of CSII. We included all patients for whom we had sufficient data for at least 1 year for both the pre- and post-CSII periods and only those patients who had received MIIT before CSII (N = 58). To eliminate potential biases, we excluded HbA(1c) values for the first year after initiation of CSII therapy.
For the entire study group, the mean HbA(1c) +/- standard error for the 3-year period before insulin pump therapy (during MIIT) was 8.4 +/- 0.2% versus a mean HbA(1c) of 7.7 +/- 0.1% for the 3-year period after the first year of CSII. This 0.7% improvement in HbA(1c) was statistically significant (P = 0.001). Of the 34 patients with HbA(1c) values above 8.0% during MIIT, the mean HbA(1c) decreased from 9.2 +/- 0.2% with use of MIIT to 8.2 +/- 0.2% with CSII (P = 0.0006). In the 17 patients with HbA(1c) values above 9.0% during MIIT, the mean HbA(1c) declined from 10.0 +/- 0.3% with use of MIIT to 8.4 +/- 0.3% with CSII (P = 0.0006).
We conclude that implementation of intensive insulin therapy with CSII improves glycemic control, even in patients in whom MIIT has previously been used to its maximal effect.

[Present role of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) by  insulin pump in the treatment of diabetes mellitus].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11132530/),"
Since the publication of the DCCT results, intensive insulin treatment, including continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII), has been considered one of the best methods for near-normal insulin delivery. The development of new, robust and easily programmable insulin pumps has led to readier acceptance of this therapy by physicians and patients. In clinical trials, CSII was found to be superior to multiple daily injection regimens in many cases. Patients with unsatisfactory glucose control, frequent hypoglycaemic events, and otherwise uncontrollable morning rises of blood glucose may in particular benefit from insulin pump therapy. Glucose control can even be improved in CSII if insulin lispro is used instead of regular human insulin, as demonstrated in many clinical investigations. Possible side effects of CSII are increased risk of ketoacidosis (e.g. in the case of catheter occlusion) and side effects at the infusion site. Since the successful development of devices for continuous glucose monitoring, the development of closed-loop systems has become more and more the focus of current clinical and technological research.

Between November 1986 and January 2000, 28 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were enrolled in the implanted insulin pump study at Johns Hopkins Hospital. An additional two patients underwent pump implantation under compassionate use guidelines due to apparent resistance to subcutaneously administered insulin uptake. The mean patient age was 44 +/- 10.5 years. Eleven patients (39%) were female and the mean duration of diabetes was 25.7 +/- 8.9 years. Diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy were present in 43%, 25% and 11 % of patients, respectively. The insulin pumps functioned safely for a total of 189 patient years. Mean pump life was 26 +/- 1.2 months. There was no mortality. Morbidity was limited to pump-site infections [n=y (4%) of all pumps placed], one case of pump migration and skin erosion, and one small bowel obstruction associated with the pump catheter. Mean serum hemoglobin AIC levels before and after pump placement were 9.0 +/- 2.9% and 7.5 +/- 0.7% (P=0.0023), respectively. Correspondingly, the mean daily blood glucose levels decreased from l61 +/- 40 mg/dl before placement to 141 +/- 27 mg/dl after pump placement (P=0.0063). Intraperitoneal delivery of insulin by a mechanical pump appears to be an attractive alternative for the treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

Insulin desensitization with insulin lispro and an insulin pump in a 5-year-old child.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11101184/),"
Allergic reactions to insulin, though rare, can have serious consequences in children with type I diabetes mellitus. We report a case of insulin allergy in a 5-year-old child in whom insulin desensitization was accomplished using an insulin pump.
A 5-year-old girl with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) developed progressive reactions to insulin and was found to have positive intradermal skin tests to regular and NPH insulin. Addition of oral antihistamine and co-administration of subcutaneous dexamethasone along with the insulin failed to control her symptoms. The patient was therefore hospitalized and desensitized to insulin using an insulin pump and insulin lispro.
An insulin pump can be used for insulin desensitization in selected children. The slow constant infusion rate provided by the pump may be an ideal means of achieving insulin desensitization. In addition, insulin lispro, a synthetic insulin analog, should be considered for use in insulin-allergic individuals.

Glycemic control, perinatal outcome, and health care costs were evaluated among women with type 1 diabetes mellitus who began insulin pump therapy during pregnancy (group 1, n = 24), were treated with multiple insulin injections (group 2, n = 24), or were already using an insulin pump before pregnancy (group 3, n = 12). Patient satisfaction and continuation of pump therapy post partum were assessed.
A retrospective review of maternal and neonatal medical records was performed, and a questionnaire was sent to patients after delivery. Patients in groups 1 and 2 were matched for age, age at onset and duration of diabetes mellitus, White class, and date of delivery.
No differences in glycosylated hemoglobin A levels were observed among groups 1, 2 or 3 in the first, second, or third trimester. Patients in group 1 started pump therapy at a mean of 16.8 weeks' gestation, and 17 (70.8%) began therapy as outpatients. No deterioration in glycemic control was noted during the 2- to 4-week period after the start of pump treatment. Among the women in group 1 eight had at least one episode of severe hypoglycemia before starting pump therapy, but only one had such an episode after this treatment was begun. Two episodes of ketoacidosis occurred in group 1, and no episodes occurred in groups 2 and 3. No significant differences in perinatal outcomes or health care costs were observed among groups 1, 2, and 3. After delivery 94. 7% of the women in group 1 continued to use the pump because it provided better glycemic control and a more flexible lifestyle. Postpartum glycosylated hemoglobin A values were 7.2% in group 1 and 9.1% in group 2, a significant difference.
Insulin pump therapy was initiated during pregnancy without a deterioration of glycemic control and was associated with maternal and perinatal outcomes and health care costs comparable to those among women who were already using the pump before pregnancy or who received multiple-dose insulin therapy. Women who began pump therapy in pregnancy were highly likely to continue pump use after delivery and preferred the flexible lifestyle that this treatment allowed.

Because of age-related developmental and cognitive issues, children <10 years of age may not be able to wear an insulin pump safely when they are not under direct parental supervision. The purpose of this study was to determine if insulin pump therapy at nighttime only, when children are at home, could improve fasting and nighttime blood glucose levels without adverse effects.
The study cohort consisted of 10 children aged 7-10 years. A randomized crossover design was used to compare nighttime-only pump usage from dinner and throughout the night, combined with a prebreakfast injection of intermediate-acting NPH and rapid-acting lispro insulin, with 3 insulin injections per day. Comparisons were made among mean blood glucose values and percentage of blood glucose levels within the target range (70-150 mg/dl) before meals, at bedtime, and at 3:00 A.M.; serum fructosamine levels; and scores on measures of adherence and fear of hypoglycemia.
Compared with baseline levels, the use of the pump resulted in a significant decrease in the mean average (P < 0.001), breakfast (P < 0.0001), and 3:00 A.M. (P < 0.003) blood glucose levels. There was a decrease in the percentage of blood glucose values less than the target range (P < 0.01) and in fructosamine (P < 0.01) values and an increase in the percentage of blood glucose levels within the target range (P < 0.03).

New concepts and applications in the use of the insulin pump during pregnancy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10757434/),"
Subcutaneous insulin infusion or insulin pump therapy has been advocated as an alternative to multiple dose insulin injections for nearly two decades. These devices provide insulin administration in a pattern which more closely resembles that of physiologic insulin release, a basal insulin infusion during the day and throughout the night with boluses given prior to meals. Because the number of patients using an insulin pump is increasing, it is likely the perinatologist will encounter women who are being treated with an insulin infusion pump or are considering this therapy. Insulin pump therapy requires that the patient be highly motivated and compliant. One of the most important criteria in selecting patients for this treatment is their willingness to test their capillary glucose levels 6 to 8 times each day. Interruption of the insulin infusion can produce hyperglycemia in any pump user. Should this occur in the pregnant patient, the likelihood of ketoacidosis developing is significantly greater. Ideally, insulin pump therapy should be initiated prior to pregnancy so that glucose control can be normalized, thereby reducing the risk for spontaneous abortion and fetal malformations. Gradually improving glucose control prior to pregnancy can reduce the likelihood of deterioration of retinopathy, which has been observed when poorly controlled pregnant patients rapidly become euglycemic. The published experience with the insulin pump has demonstrated that this therapy can achieve glucose control and perinatal outcomes comparable to that obtained with multiple-dose insulin injection therapy.

Insulin pump therapy in type 1 pediatric patients: now and into the year 2000.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10585620/),"
There are a number of medical conditions such as growth failure in children, pregnancy, lipid abnormalities, and early complications that are improved by the meticulous glycemic control that can be achieved with insulin pump therapy (CSII). By using an insulin pump, many patients with severe hypoglycemia, the dawn phenomenon, extremes of glycemic excursion, recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) and hypoglycemia unawareness have amelioration of these problems. However, pump therapy involves problems such as weight gain, recurrent ketosis due to pump failure, infections, and risk of hypoglycemia. Owing to many developmental issues, young children may not be able to wear the pump without parental supervision. We have used the pump at night time only in these patients. This has allowed children of 7-10 years of age to benefit from improved nocturnal glycemia without the risk of pump therapy when they are without an adult to help. We have also used the pump in subjects with recurrent DKA and in our general patient population (mean age 13.6+/-3.9 years). In our pump cohort, CSII led to improvement in quality of life, knowledge, adherence, and responsibility. A reduction in hypoglycemia, DKA rate and mean HbA(1c) was associated with pump usage. For this to occur, however, pump education must be geared to the pediatric subject and his/her family. Education materials and tools help in learning how to use the pump and how to deal with the intricacies of basal and bolus dosing, and the effect of exercise, food and illness on diabetes management. The pump has improved since it was first introduced and these modifications have made it easier, more painless and less hazardous. With the development of continuous glucose sensors and implantable pumps, the next century will see pump therapy lead to the artificial pancreas.

"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. A new way to lower risk of severe hypoglycemia, improve metabolic control, and enhance coping in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10546007/),"
Recommendations from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) indicate that adolescents with type 1 diabetes should be treated with intensive therapy involving multiple daily injections (MDI) of insulin or insulin pump therapy (continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion [CSII] to help obtain better metabolic control and prevent later complications. Interest has thus focused on insulin pump therapy to help adolescents meet this challenge. The purpose of this study was to examine responses to CSII and MDI in a large group of adolescents with established type 1 diabetes during a 12-month period and to determine whether either treatment regimen more favorably affected clinical and psychosocial outcomes.
One-third of 75 youths aged 12-20 years who were candidates for intensive therapy chose CSII as their mode of treatment. Patients received intensive treatment and education as described by the DCCT investigators. Psychosocial data (e.g., quality of life, depression, self-efficacy, and coping) were collected at baseline and at 6-month intervals, and clinical data (e.g., HbA1c levels, adverse events) were collected every 4-6 weeks.
Although both MDI- and CSII-treated adolescents initially exhibited improved metabolic control, this level of control was more difficult to sustain for 12 months in the MDI group (at 6 months HbA1c = 8.1, at 12 months HbA1c = 8.3), whereas average HbA1c levels in the CSII group continued to decrease during the 12 months of treatment (at 6 months HbA1c = 7.7, at 12 months HbA1c = 7.5). Despite lower HbA1c levels in CSII-versus MDI-treated patients, the rate of severe hypoglycemic events was reduced by almost 50% in the CSII group (P = 0.01). Self-reported questionnaires demonstrated that there was improvement in self-efficacy, depression, and quality of life in both MDI- and CSII-treated patients. Finally, adolescents using CSII found coping with diabetes to be less difficult than adolescents using MDI did.
CSII is an alternative means to lower HbA1c levels and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia without adversely affecting psychosocial outcomes in adolescents with type 1 diabetes.

To improve glycemic control, a hand-held plastic Insulin Dosage Guide was developed to correct blood glucose levels outside of the target range.
Protocol 1: Some 40 children (mean age 10.6+/-4.6 years) were randomly assigned for 3 months to use a written-on-paper algorithm or the Insulin Dosage Guide to correct abnormal blood glucose levels. Mean HbA1c and blood glucose levels and time to teach insulin dosage correction were compared. Protocol 2: The Insulin Dosage Guide was used by 83 subjects (mean age 11.4+/-4.3 years) for 1 year, and mean HbA1c levels, blood glucose levels, and number of consecutive high blood glucose values taken before and after the year were compared. Protocol 3: Some 20 patients (mean age 10.1+/-3.7 years) using rapid-acting insulin and 64 patients (mean age 15.9+/-3.6 years) using an insulin pump and rapid-acting insulin used the Insulin Dosage Guide and had mean blood glucose levels, HbA1c, and percentage of blood glucose levels outside of the target range determined.
Protocol 1: There was a significant reduction in mean HbA1c (P = 0.04) and blood glucose levels (P = 0.05) and in the time needed to teach how to correct blood glucose values using the Insulin Dosage Guide compared with the paper algorithm. Protocol 2: There was a decrease in mean HbA1c levels (P = 0.0001) and a decrease in the mean number of consecutive blood glucose levels (P = 0.001) over the 1-year time period. Protocol 3: With rapid-acting insulin, there was a significant increase in the percentage of blood glucose levels within the target range (1 month, P = 0.04; at 3 months, P = 0.03). With the insulin pump, there was a high rate (90%) of blood glucose levels in the target range during pump initiation when the Insulin Dosage Guide was used.
This inexpensive hand-held plastic card, which is portable and easy to use, may help patients improve glycemia and successfully manage diabetes.

Insulin replacement therapy in diabetic rats using an osmotic pump normalizes expression of enzymes key to hepatic carbohydrate metabolism.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10441380/),"
Intensively treating type I diabetics with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions or multiple daily insulin injections to normalize mean blood glucose concentrations significantly reduces the onset of secondary diabetic complications when compared to conventionally treated diabetics. Our studies focused on characterizing hepatic enzyme expression in intensively and conventionally treated diabetic rats. Alloxan-induced diabetic rats were conventionally treated with insulin injected twice daily or intensively treated with similar daily dosages of insulin administered via a surgically implanted osmotic pump. Our results demonstrate a significant difference in hepatic enzyme expression when these treatment regimes are compared. In conventionally treated diabetic rats, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) protein and mRNA levels remained slightly elevated when compared to normal animals, glycogen phosphorylase (GP) protein levels were still slightly decreased, and glycogen synthase (GS) protein and mRNA levels remained at the elevated levels observed in untreated diabetics. In contrast, the protein and mRNA levels of all three enzymes were normalized in the insulin pump-treated animals. These results suggest that intensive insulin therapy improves glycemia directly by normalizing hepatic gene expression while conventional insulin therapy normalizes plasma glucose concentrations indirectly.

Insulin lispro is an analog of human insulin with a faster onset and a shorter duration of action than regular human insulin. Efficacy and tolerability of insulin lispro in continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) treatment were assessed in an open randomized crossover trial comparing insulin lispro and regular human insulin, both applied with insulin pumps.
A total of 113 type 1 patients (60 male, 53 female, age [mean +/- SD] 37 +/- 12 years, duration of diabetes 19 +/- 9 years) participated in this open, randomized crossover study. Both insulins were applied for 4 months each with the appropriate intervals between the prandial insulin bolus and the meal (human insulin: 30 min; lispro: 0 min). Observation parameters were HbA1c, daily and postprandial blood glucose profiles, adverse events, rate of hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events, number of catheter obstructions, and treatment satisfaction as assessed with an international validated questionnaire.
The patients were well controlled with a mean HBA1c of 7.24 +/- 1.0% at baseline. HbA1c decreased in both treatment periods, but it was better during insulin lispro treatment (insulin lispro: 6.8 +/- 0.9%, regular human insulin: 6.9 +/- 1.0%, Friedman's rank-sum test: P < 0.02). In addition, the 1-h and 2-h postprandial rises in blood glucose were significantly lower (P < 0.001 for each meal) with insulin lispro, resulting in smoother daily glucose profiles as compared with regular human insulin. No significant differences were reported for the rate of hypoglycemia (mean +/- SD [median]: insulin lispro 12.4 +/- 13.9 [8], regular human insulin 11.0 +/- 11.2 [8]), for the rate of catheter obstructions (42 events in each treatment arm), and for the number and type of adverse events. No severe case of ketoacidosis was seen during insulin lispro treatment, whereas one case was reported during therapy with regular human insulin. Treatment satisfaction was better when patients were treated with insulin lispro.
Insulin lispro is a suitable and very convenient pump insulin that may result in an improvement of long-term glucose control during CSII treatment. Its safety profile does not differ from that of regular human insulin.

Surgical experience with implantable insulin pumps. Department of Veterans Affairs Implantable Insulin Pump Study Group.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9926802/),"
A recent Veterans Affairs cooperative trial demonstrated that intensive insulin therapy via an implantable pump with intraperitoneal insulin delivery reduced glycemic variability and improved quality of life compared with multiple daily insulin injections. Our aim was to determine perioperative morbidity and assess long-term function of the implantable insulin pump.
Fifty-one adult patients with type 2 diabetes had infusion pumps placed over a 2-year period at seven VA Medical Centers as part of a randomized prospective study.
All pumps were placed successfully. There were two (4%) perioperative complications. There were no wound complications. Duration of pump use ranged from 12 to 25 months (mean 20). Catheter obstruction (57%) and pump malfunction (25%) were the most common reasons for pump explantation. Catheter occlusions increased after 12 months. Catheter occlusion was treated by percutaneous rinse procedure in 75% and revisional procedures in 31% of patients.
Implantable insulin pumps can be placed with minimal surgical morbidity. Attention to surgical detail and infusion protocol permits satisfactory long-term function. Pump/catheter complications increase with time but are usually resolvable by either operative or percutaneous manipulations.

Cessation of insulin infusion at night-time during CSII-therapy: comparison of regular human insulin and insulin lispro.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9710355/),"
Development of hyperglycemia with subsequent ketoacidosis is one of the potential risks of a sudden cessation of insulin delivery during continuous insulin infusion therapy with insulin pumps in patients with IDDM. To evaluate differences in the development of ketoacidosis after a sudden pump stoppage between regular human insulin and insulin lispro, we performed an open label randomized crossover investigation with 7 patients (6 male/1 female, mean age (SD: 40.9 +/- 12.9 years). At 10 p.m., 4 hours after a light dinner with a preprandial injection of the corresponding insulin, the catheter was pulled out of the skin. During the observation period, blood glucose (every hour), pH-values and base excess values (every two hours) were measured until 7 a.m. One patient, in the insulin lispro treatment arm, discontinued because early interruption criteria were met after 7 hours. With insulin lispro, the metabolic changes developed 1.5 to 2 hours earlier than with regular human insulin (after 3 hours: difference in base excess (BE) mean +/- SD: regular human insulin: -0.41 +/- 1.04 mmol/l; insulin lispro: -1.69 +/- 0.83 mmol/l, p < 0.05; blood glucose: regular human insulin: 4.93 +/- 2.87 mmol/l, insulin lispro: 8.97 +/- 3.48, p < 0.05; pH values: regular human insulin: 7.38 +/- 0.02, insulin lispro: 7.36 +/- 0.02, n.s.). In general, metabolic deterioration tended to be more pronounced with insulin lispro than with regular human insulin (deltaBE after 7 h: regular human insulin: -2.39 +/- 1.30 mmol/l; insulin lispro: -3.27 +/- 2.43 mmol/l, n.s.). In conclusion, if patients want to be treated with insulin lispro in an insulin pump, they have to be well-educated about the pharmacokinetic properties of the insulin analogue and about the possibility that ketoacidotic deterioration after an interruption of the insulin delivery may occur earlier in comparison to regular human insulin. It is anyway recommendable to perform a pump stop test when starting CSII-treatment in patients with diabetes mellitus.

Advances toward the implantable artificial pancreas for treatment of diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9540030/),"
Recent research on development of the implantable artificial pancreas for treatment of diabetes is reviewed, based on a Medline literature search that focused on glucose sensors, insulin pumps, and pump control systems. To achieve a closed feedback loop, a clinically applicable implantable artificial pancreas requires miniaturization and coordination of three components: an insulin pump, a blood glucose monitor, and a control system. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that implantable insulin pumps are feasible for satisfactory control of diabetes for over a year, with the major complication being obstruction of the infusion catheter. Research on continuous glucose sensors has predominantly used the glucose-oxidase reaction or near-infrared light spectroscopy. Implantable glucose oxidase sensors have been limited by local factors causing unstable signal output, whereas optical sensors must overcome interference by substances with absorption spectra similar to glucose. Investigators have developed control algorithms in an effort to stabilize operation of the integrated artificial pancreas in the face of variations in sensor output and pump function. The ultimate goals of fully automatic glucose control by an artificial pancreas include prevention or delay of chronic complications of diabetes, lowered risk of hypoglycemia, and less patient inconvenience and discomfort than with multiple daily glucose self-tests and insulin injection. The recent developments of optical glucose sensing, radiotelemetry systems to link pump and sensor, and miniaturization and refinement of insulin pumps are significant steps toward a clinically applicable artificial pancreas.

Insulin pump therapy. Situations and solutions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9384140/),"
Primary care providers are now asked to render care to diabetic patients that once was the province of specialists. An increasing number of these patients are using insulin pumps to manage their diabetes. Inherent in the use of pumps are unique day-to-day situations that must be addressed with timely solutions to avoid adverse metabolic effects and to maximize the benefits of this type of therapy. To increase the primary care provider's comfort level with handling these situations, this article examines four problem areas, using a case study format followed by a discussion of the solutions to each problem. The four areas reviewed are pump training and education, infusion set change issues, skin issues, and rate adjustment.

Effect of patient-selected intensive insulin therapy on quality of life.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9128618/),"
The purpose of the study was to assess quality of life in patients with IDDM in relation to the type of insulin therapy. Two patient cohorts were studied. In cohort A, 77 patients deliberately intensified their traditional insulin injection therapy from up to two daily injections with syringe to multiple daily injections with insulin-pen; in cohort B, 55 patients changed from intensive therapy with pen to insulin pump-treatment (CSII). The therapeutic regimens were changed during a 5-day in-patient treatment and teaching course. The DCCT questionnaire was applied before and up to 6 months after changing of therapy. Treatment satisfaction increased after intensification of insulin therapy in both groups, mainly due to greater flexibility with leisure-time activities, and with the diet. Pump-users reported reduced problems with hypoglycemia (P < 0.02). HbA1c indicating acceptable metabolic control already before the study, remained unchanged. Therapy-associated inconvenience, mainly in association with lifestyle, improved in IDDM patients deliberately intensifying their insulin therapy by pens or pumps (CSII). Pump-treatment, rather than pen-therapy, conferred particular protection from hypoglycaemia.

Use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion in young adolescents with diabetes mellitus: a case study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9052055/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) was initiated in a young female adolescent with severe insulin resistance, decreased growth velocity, and poor metabolic control. The patient's insulin dose had been 3 u/kg/day, and it was hypothesized that her insulin requirements would be much less when only regular insulin was used. Because of the potential risk of severe hypoglycemia from giving regular insulin in amounts equivalent to her injection total daily dose as a constant subcutaneous infusion, the patient was hospitalized to begin pump therapy. Hourly glucose levels were collected for 24 hours to determine insulin requirements with this therapy. The patient subsequently required a significantly reduced dose of insulin (1.2 u/kg/day) with CSII, and her growth velocity improved. Metabolic control based on glycosylated hemoglobin levels also improved. Insulin pump treatment proved to be a viable solution for this young adolescent who required large doses of insulin to maintain reasonable control. Challenges of using this type of therapy in young patients are discussed.

Long-term therapy of IDDM with an implantable insulin pump. The Implantable Insulin Pump Trial Study Group.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9028695/),"
To examine the long-term benefits and risks of treatment of IDDM with an implantable programmable insulin pump.
Seventy-six patients with IDDM were studied at nine clinical centers. After 3-4 months of intensive subcutaneous therapy, the Infusaid Model 1000 pump was implanted, and insulin was delivered either intraperitoneally or intravenously for an average of 39.6 +/- 10 months (251 patient-years). Data was collected for glycemic control, lipid levels, weight gain, insulin requirements, adverse events, and quality of life. Sixty-three patients were also followed for 8.5 +/- 6.3 months (45 patient-years) after pump therapy was discontinued.
Mean quarterly HbA1c fell with subcutaneous intensive therapy and remained stable on implantable pump therapy between 6.9 and 7.5%. Severe hypoglycemia was relatively rare, with only 4 episodes/100 patient-years of implantable pump therapy. This rate was significantly less than with subcutaneous intensive therapy before implantable pump initiation (33 episodes/100 patient-years) or after discontinuation of implantable pump therapy (36/100 patient-years) (P < 0.003). Weight did not increase significantly in the 1st year of therapy, but increased by 2.0 +/- 4.3 kg after 3 years of therapy. There were no significant differences in metabolic control or adverse events between intraperitoneal and intravenous insulin therapy except for minor differences in lipid levels and the more frequent development of catheter obstruction with intravenous delivery. Most pump slow-downs and catheter occlusions were corrected noninvasively. Quality of life, as measured by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial instrument, showed high satisfaction and improved impact scores.
Long-term implantable pump therapy maintained HbA1c in a range similar to intensive subcutaneous therapy, but with fewer episodes of severe hypoglycemia. Although pump and catheter occlusions remain a limitation, patient satisfaction with implantable pump therapy remains high.

To determine whether implantable insulin pump (IIP) therapy and multiple daily insulin (MDI) injections could equally attain improved blood glucose control, and to compare the 2 treatments with respect to reducing daily blood glucose fluctuations, reducing serious hypoglycemic insulin reactions, and improving patients' quality of life.
Randomized clinical trial.
Seven Veterans Affairs medical centers.
One hundred twenty-one male type II diabetic patients between the ages of 40 and 69 years, receiving at least 1 injection of insulin per day and having hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 8% or above.
Intensive therapy (IIP or MDI) for 1 year.
Hemoglobin A1c and blood glucose levels.
Blood glucose levels declined to 7.96+/-1.08 mmol/L (143.4+/-19.5 mg/dL) and 8.30+/-1.52 mmol/L (149.6+/-27.4 mg/dL) (mean +/- SD) for IIP and MDI, respectively (P=.57). Hemoglobin A1c levels improved in both groups (time effect P<.001), to means of 7.54%+/-0.83% (MDI) vs 7.34%+/-0.79% (IIP). IIP reduced blood glucose fluctuations compared with MDI (P<.001), and reduced the incidence of mild clinical hypoglycemia by 68% (P<.001); IIP also eliminated the weight gain associated with MDI therapy and yielded better overall quality-of-life (P=.03) and impact-of-disease subscale scores (P=.05). Adverse events included 25% of subjects with episodes of insulin underdelivery due to microprecipitates of insulin within the pump.
Intensive insulin therapy with IIP and MDI is effective in controlling non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. IIP has significant advantages in reducing glycemic variability, clinical hypoglycemia, and weight gain, while improving aspects of quality of life.

[Remission of severe hypoglycemic incidents in young diabetic children treated with subcutaneous infusion].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8952790/),"
Conventional insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus can be inadequate for controlling glycemia in young patients in whom the risk of hypoglycemia is particularly high.
A retrospective study comparing all the children under 6 years of age treated in our department by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (group P, n = 10, mean age: 3.7 years) to 17 children with conventional insulin therapy (group C, mean age: 5.1 years) was conducted during a mean period of 2 years.
Mean insulin doses, HbAlc, pre-prandial and daily glycemic levels, measured at 0, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, did not differ significantly between both groups. Mean HbAlc levels remained < or = 8% in the two groups. There was no episode of severe hypoglycemia in group P vs ten episodes in group C (P < 0.05); this benefit was confirmed in those six children belonging to group P who had previously followed a conventional therapy: 11 episodes during the conventional period vs 0 episode during the pump period (P < 0.05). Nine out of ten families were very satisfied with the treatment by pump mainly because of a more comfortable life style and a reduction of parents' anxiety due to disappearance of severe hypoglycemias. The insulin pump therapy had some limits: cutaneous complications and technical ones were responsible for two keto-acidosis episodes (0.1 episode per year-patient) and a higher frequency of hospitalizations. In group C, hospitalizations were caused by severe hypoglycemias and unbalanced glycemic control.
Insulin pump therapy could be indicated in young diabetic children at high risk of severe hypoglycemia under conditions of a specialized medical and educational supervision and knowledge of the limits of such a treatment.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin injection was used for the self-care of five patients aged 10-18 years with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. After an introduction to the concept and procedures for continuous subcutaneous injection, the patients soon became familiar with self-care using an insulin pump at home and at school. Three months later, the control of blood glucose improved with smaller doses of insulin in four cases and milder hypoglycemia was observed compared to when using multiple injections. Significantly decreased variations and lowered means of early morning blood glucose values were observed and seemed to explain the reason for better glycemic control. Buffered regular insulin continuously injected by pumps brought a more stable nocturnal blood glucose level compared to isophane insulin injected at bedtime, the absorption of which seemed to vary considerably. On the contrary, unbuffered regular insulin injected by pumps brought frequent nocturnal hypoglycemia, sudden worsening of glycemic control and skin infections and thus, was deemed inadequate for continuous subcutaneous injection.

The aim of this study was to develop procedures for the diagnosis and nonsurgical management of decreased insulin flow in an implantable programmable pump for long-term intraperitoneal or intravenous insulin delivery featuring a sideport. Patency of the catheter lumen was tested by measuring the time needed for sideport pressure to decrease by 50% after the injection of 0.1 ml of buffer solution. Pumping unit performances were assessed by measuring the volume of pump pulses after diverting the pump flow at the sideport. A catheter flush with buffer solution through the sideport was effective in clearing 79% of intraperitoneal and 84% of intravenous catheter occlusions. Washing the pumping unit with an alkaline solution after diverting pump flow at the sideport was effective in dissolving insulin aggregates inside the pumping unit and in restoring normal pump flow. These procedures were associated with a 1.3% rate of hypoglycemic episodes.

Insulin underdelivery from implanted pumps using peritoneal route. Determinant role of insulin pump compatibility.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8842596/),"
To evaluate the incidence and investigate determinants of insulin underdelivery events occurring with implanted pumps using peritoneal route from a 103 patient-year experiment.
Of the MiniMed (MIP 2001) pumps implanted in 47 type I diabetic patients, 70 were refilled quarterly with four successive batches (A, B, C, D) of U400 Hoechst 21 PH neutral insulin during a 3-year study period. Any reduction of insulin flow rate > 15% was considered as abnormal insulin delivery. Diagnosis of the cause of underdelivery was established according to the response to the following steps: 1) 0.01 mol/l NaOH rinse of pump circuits to solubilize insulin aggregates, 2) surgical examination and replacement of blocked catheters, and 3) postsurgical 0.01 mol/l NaOH rinse of pump. Step 2 was selected first if the increase of insulin requirements or reduction of flow rate were > 50%. Relative contributions of insulin and the implanted system to underdelivery events were analyzed.
There were 76 episodes of insulin underdelivery that occurred during the study, resulting in an incidence of 74 events per 100 patient-years. Of 52 NaOH pump rinses, 30 restored normal flow rate. Surgery, performed after rinse failure (n = 22) or as the first step (n = 24), disclosed catheter blockages due to tip obstructions in 28 cases and omental encapsulations in 18 other cases. Five combined severe reductions of pump flow rate requiring pump replacements were diagnosed during surgery, and additional NaOH rinses had to be performed after catheter change in 12 other cases. Analysis of the incidence of underdelivery events indicated that both pump- and catheter-related problems were significantly increased while implanted systems infused batches B, C, and D versus batch A (P < 0.01), whereas the duration of pump implantation had no significant influence.
Underdelivery events constitute serious limiting obstacles to prolonged peritoneal insulin infusion from implanted pumps. Progress in insulin pump compatibility is expected to reduce their occurrence and, thus, to improve the feasibility of this treatment.

"Postprandial insulin profiles with implantable pump therapy may explain decreased frequency of severe hypoglycemia, compared with intensive subcutaneous regimens, in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients.",[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8610727/),"
To examine the mechanism of the decreased frequency of severe hypoglycemia with implantable pump therapy compared with subcutaneous intensive therapy.
Eight subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), enrolled in an implantable insulin pump study, were admitted to the General Clinical Research Center and on 2 separate days were given either a dose of preprandial insulin chosen to maintain normoglycemia for a standard (450 kcal, 50% carbohydrate) breakfast or 1.75 times the dose. The two doses were administered subcutaneously (by syringe or with an external pump) during one inpatient admission and by implantable pump (intraperitoneally, n=6; or intravenously, n=2) during a separate admission. Blood glucose, plasma-free insulin, and neurocognitive function were measured for 4 hours after the meal.
Subcutaneous administration resulted in 7 episodes of hypoglycemia (2 with the usual dose and 5 with the 1.75-fold dose), defined as blood glucose less than 50 mg/dL; implantable pump treatment resulted in only 2 episodes, both with the 1.75-fold dose (P <0.05, Fisher's two-tailed test for implantable versus subcutaneous). Compared with subcutaneous delivery, implantable pump therapy provided significantly lower insulin levels during the final 2 hours after administration of the usual dose and the 1.75-fold dose (P <0.005). In addition to the decreased frequency of hypoglycemia, implantable pump therapy resulted in significantly lower area under the glycemia curve during the first 120 minutes with the 1.75-fold dose compared with subcutaneous administration.
The lower frequency of severe hypoglycemia with intensive therapy administered by implantable pump therapy is explained by the more rapid clearance of insulin delivered intraperitoneally or intravenously compared with intensive subcutaneous injection regimens. The lower frequency of severe hypoglycemia with implantable pump therapy compared with subcutaneous therapy demonstrated in clinical trials is confirmed by this study, in which we attempted to induce hypoglycemia.

Additionally, a nonrandom sample of three MIP recipients from an additional site were included in the MIP group. At regular assessment intervals, all participants completed self-report questionnaires regarding psychosocial functioning and monitored blood glucose levels. After 4 months of MIP use, MIP recipients did not significantly differ from control subjects on any measure of psychosocial functioning; however, MIP use did have an impact on diabetes self-care. The MIP users monitored their blood glucose levels more frequently and had lower average blood glucose levels than control subjects. Additional follow-up is needed to determine the long-term psychosocial impact of implantable insulin pump therapy.

An improved version of the Siemens implantable system has been evaluated in 6 European centres on 31 type I diabetic patients treated for 10-30 months. Contrary to other pump models there were no proven pump malfunctions and only one no-flow reduction unrelated to catheter obstruction. The latter resulted in 12 surgical catheter replacements. There were 2.0 incidents of programmer malfunctions per patient-year easily managed by reconfiguration or replacement. Insulin remained clear and active in the pump reservoir and glycaemic control remained in the near-normoglycaemic range. Thus, insulin therapy with the Siemens implantable pump is feasible and effective up to 2.5 years.

Eighty-one patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus known to be affected before their pregnancy were followed in the unit from 1980 to 1991. This population was divided into two groups: in the first group, an insulin pump was installed before 15 weeks of amenorrhoea (n = 36) and in the second group, conventional treatment was given with three daily injections of insulin or with a pump installed after 15 weeks of amenorrhoea (n = 45).
In the first group with the insulin pump before 15 weeks, there was a higher proportion of severe diabetes, the first consultation occurred earlier, there were half as many cases of neonatal jaundice and the length of hospitalization during the first trimester of pregnancy was longer. There was no difference in Apgar scores, cord pH, birth weight and the proportion of foetal macrosomia, length of the hospitalization in the neonatality ward, rate of malformation, infection, low blood glucose and calcium, transitive respiratory distress and neonatal polycythaemia, length of hospitalization of the mother during the second and third week postpartum, the rate of urinary infection, high blood pressure, hydramnios during pregnancy, delivery route, haemoglobin Alc or fructosamine during pregnancy. There was no perinatal death.
Although there was no significant difference in the results, which may be explained by the higher number of severe cases of diabetes in the first group, the use of the insulin pump did not appear to improve control of blood glucose levels, and thus to improve the materno-foetal prognosis, except by the bias of earlier attentive management of the pregnancy which led to better outcome.

To identify characteristics of adult patients at baseline associated with duration of subsequent, continuous, subcutaneous infusion of insulin treatment (pump therapy) of type I diabetes.
For 6 wk, patients followed a standardized conventional therapy and kept a record of insulin dosages, capillary blood glucose concentrations, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. They were then hospitalized. Additional baseline data were obtained and pump therapy was started. Survival analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline independent variables or risk factors and duration of pump therapy, which is the dependent variable.
Of the 68 participants, 33 (49%) terminated pump therapy after an average of 9.9 mo of treatment. Two models (each P < 0.00005) were developed that exhibited a high degree of consistency. Of the 6 variables, 5 were common to both models (HbA1, autonomic neuropathy, mean amplitude of glycemic excursions, frequency of symptoms of hypoglycemia when blood glucose was < 70 mg/dl, and erythema at injection sites). The sixth variable in model 1 (insulin dosage) was replaced in model 2 by a variable, Adult Self-Efficacy for Diabetes, which was obtained on the 33 more recently enrolled patients; this variable related to patient perceptions of self-care behaviors.
We found that, at baseline, the presence of a high concentration of HbA1 and a low estimation by the patient of their ability to treat the disease portend failure of insulin pump therapy as evidenced by its discontinuation. This effect is accentuated when clinical evidence of autonomic neuropathy is observed. These findings offer guidance in selecting patients with type I diabetes for insulin pump therapy.

To characterize the effects of subcutaneous insulin pump therapy on the metabolic response (CHO and lipid oxidation, and nonoxidative glucose metabolism) to a glucose challenge of diabetic women at early pregnancy.
Seven nondiabetic and seven IDDM pregnant patients on insulin pump therapy were studied at the first trimester. Fuel oxidation rates were determined by indirect calorimetry, and blood levels of substrates and hormones were measured before and for 2 h after ingestion of a 50 g oral glucose load.
The increments in npRQ and CHO oxidation rates after the glucose meals in the diabetic women on insulin pump therapy were similar to those in the normal subjects. The glucose disposal data during the 2 h of the studies revealed that the amounts of oxidative and nonoxidative glucose utilization in the control subjects and in the IDDM patients on insulin pump therapy did not show significant differences.
This investigation demonstrated that the treatment of IDDM patients during early pregnancy by an open-loop insulin infusion system is sufficient to normalize their glucose-processing capability with respect to cellular oxidative and nonoxidative glucose metabolism in response to an oral glucose challenge, but some abnormalities in their blood profiles of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate persisted.

Initiation and management of insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8267697/),"
Insulin infusion pump therapy is a treatment option that facilitates achieving improved blood glucose control and lifestyle flexibility. These advantages are derived from the physiologic mode of insulin delivery and the pharmacologic advantages of using rapid-acting insulin. Patients who are sufficiently motivated and capable can learn to use the pump so that insulin adjustments can be made to compensate for changing circumstances. Although there are potential risks and side effects of using an insulin pump, these can be avoided through proper education and surveillance. The health care provider should be knowledgeable about the management of infusion pump therapy, including assessment of patient capabilities and practices, education, insulin adjustment, and techniques of use. The knowledge assists the health care provider in counseling patients to consider pump therapy and to manage patients already employing this mode of insulin delivery.

Frequency of sever hypoglycemia incidents (4 in our series) and of biological hypoglycemia (blood-sugar < 65 mg/100 ml) was decreased, representing major benefit of the technique. The patients well-being and quality of life were notably amended. Implantable insulin-pump may be offered as a treatment alternative to conventional insulin-therapy, especially in cases of diabetes which are difficult to balance and particularly in cases with frequent hypoglycemic malaise.

Experience accumulated with 17 pediatric patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus treated with an insulin pump is reported. Follow-up exceeds four years in seven patients. A significant improvement in metabolic control was seen in only four patients and was confined to the first year of use of the pump. Overall, the improvement in control was not significant. Severe hypoglycemia was uncommon (0.27/patient-year). Ketoacidosis was rare (0.08/patient-year). Transient ketosis was the most common adverse event and was often related to technical problems which should immediately lead to appropriate action by patients who have received proper education. Use of an insulin pump remains an alternative which deserves to be considered when conventional therapies fail.

Long-term implantation of a new implantable programmable insulin pump in two diabetic dogs.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10078304/),"
A positive-pressure implantable programmable pump with an integrated sideport and a detachable catheter was tested for long-term intraperitoneal insulin delivery in 2 diabetic dogs. Programming and refilling of the pump was simple and presented no problems during 28 months of pump function. During pump therapy an acceptable degree of glycemic control was maintained. No catheter occlusion occurred, and no skin erosions or infections were observed. Insulin in the pump reservoir was stable. After 9.5 months of pump function, flow progressively decreased because of insulin precipitation in the valved accumulator. Solubilization of these precipitates using 0.1 N NaOH injected in the reservoir and drained through the sideport normalized pump delivery rates. We conclude that this device is safe for long-term intraperitoneal insulin delivery. The sideport enables discrimination between different causes of pump malfunction and allows for the safe use of an alkaline solution to remove insulin precipitates, thus avoiding pump explantation.

Eight type 1 diabetics treated on account of a great lability of the disease are free from specific complications. In 10 type 1 diabetics treated on account of developing nephropathy and neuropathy the condition has stabilized and does not develop further. In 14 type 2 diabetics progression of complications which led to the indication of pump treatment did not occur. Treatment had the most favourable effect on sensitive neuropathy and incipient nephropathy where a reduction of proteinuria was recorded. From the total number of 228 patients treated on a long-term basis in 31, on failure of the pump, decompensation occurred. Five of these patients developed ketosis which called for hospitalization.

Long-term intraperitoneal insulin delivery.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1417197/),"
Over the past 5 years, 21 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus have been managed at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions with variable rate, remotely controlled implanted insulin pumps. To date, nearly 70 patient-years of experience has been gained with intraperitoneal delivery of a new U-400 insulin with a surfactant. All 21 patients are alive after a mean of 39.3 months (range, 10 to 65 months) after insulin pump implantation. Nineteen of the 21 patients remain on intraperitoneal insulin, for a 5-year actuarial system survival of 90%. Glucose control was improved, especially during the first 16 months after pump implantation, without an increased incidence of severe hypoglycemia. Catheter blockage has been a significant problem, occurring in nine of the 21 patients (43%). Catheter occlusion has been successfully managed, however, with laparoscopic repair in seven of 10 attempts or with catheter change in four of five patients. Nevertheless, quality of life and patient acceptance remain excellent. Moreover, pre-existing nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy have been surprisingly stable. With an aggressive policy of catheter change or laparoscopic clearance of catheter blockage, long-term intraperitoneal insulin delivery is now a safe and effective treatment for type I diabetics.

Clinical trial of programmable implantable insulin pump for type I diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1516508/),"
The first step in the evolution of an artificial pancreas is the development of a reliable implantable pump for insulin delivery. Despite recent advances, significant issues remain, including small size of studies and frequent irreversible catheter obstructions. We report safety, feasibility, and efficacy results from 56 patients, representing 73 patient-yr of pump experience, entered into a multicenter trial with a new implantable programmable pump.
All patients had insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes, were 38 +/- 8 yr old, and were not prone to severe hypoglycemia. The pump (Infusaid 1000) has a pulsatile mechanism powered by freon-vapor pressure. Its rate is regulated by battery-powered valves, operated via a hand-held programmer. The pump is refilled transcutaneously with 25 ml U100 insulin (Hoechst 21PH) on a monthly basis and has a second septum (side port) proximal to the catheter, which allows flushing the catheter or lavaging the pump unit. The pumps were implanted after 3 mo intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy and catheters were positioned either in the peritoneum (i.p., n = 38) or the superior vena cava (i.v., n = 18).
All implanted pumps have functioned safely with no instance of overdelivery or stoppage. The most frequent complications were flow slow downs, presumably due to insulin precipitation within the pump, which occurred in 86% of pumps and were resolved in all but one case by lavaging the pump in situ with alkaline solution. Flow slow downs due to catheter obstruction occurred in 52% of the intravenous catheters but only 21% of the intraperitoneal catheters (P less than 0.05) and were resolved in all but two cases by diluent flushing through the sideport. Incidence of severe hypoglycemia decreased from 0.47 before implant to 0.05 episodes/patient-yr after pump implantation (P less than 0.001). Mean HbA1c fell from 7.4 +/- 1.2% after intensive subcutaneous therapy to 7.1 +/- 1.0% 12 mo after implantation. Only 2 patients withdrew from study after recurrent catheter problems, and quality-of-life questionnaires showed improvement in satisfaction with diabetes-specific quality of life when on implantable pump therapy.
Insulin therapy with implantable pumps is effective and safe for periods up to 1.7 yr with a decreased risk of severe hypoglycemia than with intensive subcutaneous insulin therapy.

Conventional insulin therapy for diabetes mellitus is sometimes inadequate for controlling metabolic disturbances in young children; the risk of hypoglycemia is particularly high at this age.
Ten newly-diagnosed insulin-dependent diabetic children aged 1 to 7 years were treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion using a portable pump. The mean duration of treatment was 17 months (4 to 42 months).
The mean individual capillary blood glucose calculated over periods of 6 months ranged from 84 +/- 23 to 206 +/- 97 mg/dl. The glycosylated hemoglobin values were 6.5 to 8.9% during the same period. There was no hypoglycemic coma; 7 children experienced a total of 16 episodes of ketonuria. The average daily dose of insulin used by these 10 patients was 0.72 +/- 0.24 units/kg.
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is a feasible therapy and it was well tolerated even in the youngest children. External insulin infusion devices appear to be an alternative to conventional insulin therapy and a way of overcoming the therapeutic difficulties encountered with these young patients.

Artificial connection between glucose sensing and insulin delivery: implications of peritoneal administration.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10078237/),"
The replacement of insulinogenic function in insulin-dependent diabetes has to restore the feedback between intracorporal glucose and insulin. This has been accomplished by the following approaches: (a) the so-called open-loop insulin treatment by means of injections or pumps, employing laboratory or other extracorporal analytical devices and closing the feedback at large intervals only; (b) transplantation of insulin producing tissue and the bioartificial pancreas, employing the natural beta-cell both for glucose sensing and insulin delivery; (c) implanted artificial drug delivery systems providing chemical feedback between intracorporal glucose and insulin release from a nonrefillable reservoir of limited capacity; (d) the intracorporal or paracorporal artificial beta-cell comprising a glucose sensor (electrochemical or other type) that permanently delivers the signal to the computer-controlled insulin pump. This artificial device works on the basis of an algorithm of glucose-dependent insulin provision, compensating for the lack of other regulators, for the site of insulin administration, which is usually posthepatic, and for the kinetic properties of sensing system, e.g., a subcutaneous inserted amperometric electrode. Present experimental studies show that the pharmacodynamics of peritoneally applied insulin may be implemented into a mathematical model of the overall glucose-insulin system. They include absorption nearly as fast as after intravenous application, predominant portal inflow and approximately 30% hepatic removal. Feedback-controlled peritoneal insulin administration by means of an artificial beta-cell working on peripheral-venous blood glucose monitoring results in normal glycemic profiles under basal conditions and during oral glucose loads, if the pharmacodynamic properties of the peritoneal route are implemented into the insulin dosage algorithm.

Insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1933705/),"
Insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease characterized by hyperglycemia, impaired metabolism and storage of important nutrients, evidence of autoimmunity, and long-term vascular and neurologic complications. Insulin secretory function is limited. Cell membrane binding is not primarily involved. The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and to achieve blood glucose levels as close to normal as possible without severe hypoglycemia. However, even with education and self-monitoring of the blood glucose level, attaining recommended target values (plasma glucose level less than 8.0 mmol/L before main meals for adults) remains difficult. Human insulin offers no advantage in glycemic control but is important in the management and prevention of immune-related clinical problems (e.g., injection-site lipoatrophy, insulin resistance and allergy) associated with the use of beef or pork insulin. Therapy with one or two injections per day of mixed short-acting or intermediate-acting insulin preparations is a compromise between convenience and the potential for achieving target plasma glucose levels. Intensive insulin therapy with multiple daily injections or continuous infusion with an insulin pump improves mean glycated hemoglobin levels; however, it increases rates of severe hypoglycemia and has not been shown to decrease the incidence of clinically significant renal, retinal or neurologic dysfunction. Future prospects include automated techniques of insulin delivery, immunosuppression to preserve endogenous insulin secretion and islet transplantation.

Recent developments in insulin delivery techniques. Current status and future potential.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1717221/),"
Although single or multiple daily subcutaneous injections of insulin are the mainstay of insulin delivery techniques, several other methods of insulin delivery are now available or in development, including: (a) continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by a wearable infusion pump; (b) total or segmental transplantation of a pancreas; (c) transplantation of isolated islet cells; (d) implantation of a programmable insulin pump; (e) oral, nasal, rectal and transdermal mechanisms of insulin delivery; (f) insulin analogues; (g) implantation of polymeric capsules which give continuous or time-pulsed release of insulin; and (h) implantation of a biohybrid artificial pancreas which uses encapsulated islets. Many of these methods of insulin delivery are aimed at achieving a more physiological means of delivery of the insulin, thus to improve glycaemic control and hopefully minimise the secondary complications of diabetes. Techniques of multiple insulin injections and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pumps are already in widespread use and are resulting in improved glycaemic control. With the recent increased use of pancreatic transplantation, the rule of establishing euglycaemia will be elucidated in the treatment and prevention of microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus. Despite these advances, the ideal delivery of insulin to patients has yet to be developed. Subcutaneous methods of insulin delivery do not precisely mimic physiological insulin needs and transplantation requires risky immunosuppression. However, the future does look bright as glucose sensors are developed and insulin analogues synthesised.

After stabilization of treatment by the pump, the patients were left on the 5th day without breakfast, while the basal operation of the pump was maintained and the patient received their insulin bolus in the morning. The test was terminated as planned after 180 mins. in 6 patients, in 5 it was terminated early because of typical signs of clinical hypoglycaemia. The course of the blood sugar curves revealed differences between patients from abrupt drops of hyperglycaemic values to hypoglycaemia to balanced low blood sugar levels. For the rest of the day till the following morning after the test the blood sugar was elevated, as compared with the control level of the 4th day.
the tests revealed the relatively small drop of the blood sugar level after omission of the meal, hypoglycaemia develops in the majority of diabetics only after 120 to 180 mins. The danger of early hypoglycaemia within 60 minutes was recorded only in patients with a known history of severe hypoglycaemic states. Posthypoglycaemic hyperglycaemia influences the compensation of diabetics during the rest of the day.

Pre- and postprandial hyperinsulinemia during insulin pump treatment; role of the subcutaneous bolus and basal infusion.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1817806/),"
The impact of the bolus dose and the basal infusion during insulin pump treatment on pre- and post-prandial hyperinsulinemia was investigated in 8 insulin-dependent diabetic patients. Frequent determinations of free insulin in blood and simultaneous determination of glucose consumption with euglycaemic clamp technique were made after a bolus of 5 U with or without basal infusion and after 10 U with basal infusion. The maximum free insulin level was reached after 75, 65 and 105 min respectively (median; NS), whereas 50% of the maximum was reached already after 15, 10, and 12.5 min (NS). The fall in free insulin after the peak was slower in all protocols compared to the breakfast induced peak in healthy subjects and it was slower with than without basal infusion (p less than 0.03). Glucose consumption followed the free insulin profiles. We conclude, that administration of a subcutaneous bolus with an insulin pump gives a dose-related free insulin peak that is unphysiological in comparison with the normal meal-related insulin secretion. Preprandial hyperinsulinemia, found after a prescribed interval of 30 min between injection and meal, as well as postprandial hyperinsulinemia, increased with a greater bolus indicating that adjustments of timing of meals and snacks may be necessary when the dose is changed. Furthermore, the insulin substitution with external pumps would probably be more physiological if the basal supply was interrupted after a bolus.

Twenty-one type diabetics previously treated in the conventional way with insulin with unsatisfactory results were admitted to hospital. The blood sugar level, serum insulin and non-esterified fatty acids in serum (NEFA) were assessed from 6 a.m. to 2 a.m. during treatment with an insulin pump and after changing the patients to insulins with varying length of action. Patients in the following groups were followed up separately: a) patients with antibodies against insulin treated either by two (n = 4) or three (n = 12) injections; b) patients with antibodies (n = 16) and without antibodies (n = 5), regardless of the number of insulin injections. Changes from the insulin pump regime implied an increased insulin requirement, (significant only in group b) and deteriorated compensation of diabetes which was more markedly manifested when evaluated by index M according to Schlichkrull with the exception of the group without antibodies, where M remained despite the increase in the range of satisfactory compensation. The NEFA profile behaved in a reversed manner, as compared with the serum insulin level. The results confirm the greater success of insulin pump treatment when attempting to maintain the blood sugar level as close as possible to normal values. From the analysis of the blood sugar and serum insulin profile recommendations for the tactics of treatment are derived, when the use of an insulin pump is not possible.

The author treated for prolonged periods 179 diabetics type I and II using an insulin pump. The shortest period of treatment was 6 months, the longest three years. Treatment failed only in six patients, i.e. in 3.3%, in all instances because they were incapable of adhering to the dietetic regime or to control the function of the pump. Complications had also mainly technical reasons, in 43 patients the pump failed and had to be replaced. Indicators of metabolic compensation reached normal levels in 173 patients and the triacylglycerol and cholesterol blood levels declined significantly. Laboratory hypoglycaemia was recorded in all patients, hypoglycaemia with clinical symptoms only in 17 patients. As to specific complications of diabetes, proteinuria and neuropathy were influenced most favourably. Long-term treatment with an insulin pump is useful in type I diabetes with metabolic lability and in obese type II diabetics where weight reduction is essential because of insulin resistance. So far the effectiveness of treatment with a pump to suppress permanently progression of specific complications is controversial.

Spinal cord injured patients may lack both the clinical symptoms of, and the ability to respond to, hypoglycemia.

Because insulin pump therapy is capable of providing insulin both at a slow continuous basal rate and in boluses, it more closely approximates physiologic insulin secretion than is possible with other methods of insulin administration. However, several short-comings are specifically related to the way insulin is delivered by pumps. These include increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and increased likelihood of infection at injection sites. The risk of hypoglycemic coma is apparently no greater with pump therapy than with conventional injections. Health professionals using pump therapy need a good working knowledge of the technical details as well as of the risks and benefits, and must be prepared to provide comprehensive training to their patients, particularly in the practice of frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels.

Insulin pump use, compared to intensive insulin injections in a non-research setting, (a) is equally effective for maintenance of near normal glycosylated hemoglobin levels, (b) need not result in increased ketoacidosis, and (c) is effective for reducing hypoglycemic events.

Of the reasons to discontinue continuous implantable insulin pump therapy, flow rate reduction is the most common, occurring in 27 of 42 pumps in the University of Minnesota series. Thrombosis at the catheter tip appears to be a major reason for flow reduction. Six different procedures to restore flow in pumps were performed. Two of the procedures involve the infusion of an alkaline solution through the device, replacing the insulin/glycerol solution normally infused; the other four procedures are surgical ones involving manipulation of the catheter. In restoring flow the non-operative procedures achieved a success rate of 50%, having taken as long as 3 months to restore flow, and having allowed up to 1 year of further insulin pump therapy; flow in all the pumps so treated eventually decreased again. The operative procedures were nearly 100% successful, restored flow immediately, and allowed longer periods of adequate flow, but flow rate did again decrease. When flow rate reduction occurs further flow improvement procedures may be attempted without difficulty and are well tolerated. In implantable pumps the biocompatibility of the blood-catheter tip interface needs to be improved to deal with the recurrent problems of insulin infusion device flow rate decrease.

The development of battery-powered pumps for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion added new dimensions to control of diabetes during pregnancy. In this report, we describe our experiences with 28 pregnant diabetic women offered participation in an insulin pump program. Fifteen (54%) accepted pump therapy and ten continued usage during their pregnancies. Excluding abortions, eight women continuing pump use are compared to 11 others who declined such therapy and were treated with conventional methods. Although these two groups are small and not strictly comparable, the experiences now reported provide clinical insights into the application of this new technology during pregnancy. Women who successfully used insulin pumps were typically from the private sector and in better glucose control at study entry. The degree of control during pregnancy in women using pumps was not significantly different compared to conventional glucose control methods (mean glucose 120 mg/dl and 142 mg/dl, respectively). Similarly, several indices of pregnancy outcome including length of hospitalization, costs, and perinatal morbidity associated with diabetes were analyzed and no significant differences were observed. We conclude that insulin pumps are not acceptable to all pregnant diabetic women and that such therapy may not necessarily improve pregnancy outcome.

Controlled studies evaluating proper management of insulin infusion pump sites to prevent infections are needed.

Factors related to discontinuation of continuous subcutaneous insulin-infusion therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3123187/),"
To determine the factors related to discontinuation of continuous subcutaneous insulin-infusion (CSII) therapy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we analyzed clinical data from a group of 177 patients followed for up to 5 yr. Fifty-one (29%) of the patients made a decision to terminate CSII during the study. Of the clinical characteristics present before the onset of treatment with an insulin pump, the most important variable to predict a future decision to terminate CSII was pregnancy, followed by female gender. In addition, there was a greater percentage of smokers, single or divorced patients, and patients with a history of treatment for mental illness in the dropout group, although none of these differences was statistically significant. There was no correlation between discontinuation of CSII and age, duration of diabetes, or prepump concentrations of HbA1c. Events occurring during CSII were also analyzed for predictive value. Patients who discontinued CSII had a higher incidence of ketoacidosis and a lower incidence of hypoglycemic coma while using a pump. The most common reason reported by patients for terminating CSII therapy, cited by 24 (47%) of the 51, was discomfort, irritation, or infection at the infusion site.

Complications and fetal outcome in diabetic pregnancy. Intensified conventional versus insulin pump therapy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3065158/),"
From 1978 to 1986 a total of 189 pregnant diabetic women gave birth at our hospital. In this randomized prospective study the influence of maternal diabetes treatment in normoglycemic patients, continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (n = 48) versus intensified conventional treatment (n = 41), is evaluated. These two groups of patients are further compared to patients (n = 28) who underwent conventional diabetes treatment during pregnancy. It can be shown from our data that the rate of complications such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, premature labor and premature delivery can be reduced by intensified conventional and insulin pump treatment as compared to conventionally treated patients with late onset of pregnancy care. As expected, in the groups of CSII and ICT patients no difference in the rate of pregnancy complications nor in fetal outcome could be demonstrated. Among CSII pregnancies 12/48 were complicated, in the ICT population the respective figure was 13/41 (CT: 20/28). The mean gestational age at the time of delivery ranged between 38 and 40 weeks, depending on the severity of maternal diabetes. CT patients were delivered earlier in all White classes. Fetal morbidity was nearly equal in CSII and ICT children, in CT patients it was greatly enhanced. Also the mortality (perinatal and neonatal) was considerably larger in CT patients (6/28), again, in the CSII and ICT population the mortality was nearly identical (2/48 and 3/41). We conclude, from our prospective information, that insulin pump therapy during pregnancy is indicated if intensified conventional treatment does not lead to normoglycemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

U-100 insulin gives some protection against metabolic deterioration due to CSII interruption.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3322727/),"
We investigated the influence of insulin concentration within the insulin pump on the metabolic and plasma free-insulin changes induced by a 6-h nocturnal interruption of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in five C-peptide-negative insulin-dependent diabetic patients with low circulating levels of anti-insulin antibodies. We compared the changes in blood glucose, plasma free fatty acids, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and free insulin during the interruption from 2300 to 0500 h of the Nordisk Infuser loaded with either U-100 or U-20 regular insulin. The decrease in plasma free-insulin levels was slower, resulting in a significantly delayed and smaller increase in blood glucose levels (2.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 7.6 +/- 2.9 mM, P less than .025) when the pump contained U-100 instead of U-20 insulin. Although the increases in levels of plasma free fatty acids were similar in both tests, the rise in plasma 3-hydroxybutyrate levels tended to be reduced with U-100 insulin (414 +/- 139 vs. 639 +/- 67 microM, P less than .10). Thus, our observations indicate that U-100 insulin gives some protection against the metabolic deterioration due to the interruption of CSII so that diabetic patients may be able to remain without the pump for longer periods with concentrated rather than diluted insulin.

Controlled crossover study of subcutaneous and intravenous insulin infusion in type I diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3622203/),"
Various routes of insulin infusion have been utilized to improve metabolic control in type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes. To determine the relative effectiveness of subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) systems of insulin-pump therapy, we studied five type I diabetic subjects aged 20-39 yr who were randomly assigned to a 3-mo period of either SC or IV insulin infusion and then crossed over to the alternate route for a similar period. After an initial 7- to 14-day period of in-hospital insulin-dose adjustment, all subjects were similarly followed as outpatients during both infusion periods, with a minimum of four daily preprandial self-measurements of blood glucose. Although the overall mean levels of blood glucose and HbA1c (116 +/- 6 vs. 114 +/- 5 mg/dl and 6.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 5.9 +/- 0.1% for the SC and IV systems, respectively) were similar, there was a greater incidence of low (less than 50 mg/dl) and high (greater than 180 mg/dl) preprandial blood glucose readings during SC- than during IV-pump therapy (P less than .05). Furthermore, the frequency of nocturnal and preprandial hypoglycemia was greater during SC-pump therapy (P less than .05 and P less than .02, respectively). Eight documented technical problems related to the pump and catheter occurred with the SC system, whereas 17 episodes occurred with the IV system. The number of episodes of ketosis (4 vs. 5 for SC and IV, respectively) was similar with both systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Evaluation of insulin pump treatment under routine conditions.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3113904/),"
Sixty-six patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) initiated insulin pump treatment under routine conditions. Four patients (6%) discontinued treatment. One patient died. 61 patients were followed for a total period of 130 patient years. A sustained decrease in HbA1c was obtained during insulin pump treatment. The frequency of the following acute side effects was: ketoacidosis 0.06 episodes per patient per year, severe hypoglycaemia 0.09 episodes per patient per year and infection at the injection site 0.06 episodes per patient per year. Insulin pump treatment was well accepted by the patients; all but one wanted to continue insulin pump treatment. The major advantages were greater quality of life, greater flexibility as to meal times and better blood glucose regulation. The major disadvantages were technical problems: blockage of the infusion system, greater treatment expenses and the large pump size. We conclude that insulin pump treatment is well accepted as long-term treatment in selected IDDM patients. The improvement in metabolic control can be sustained through several years, and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia during pump treatment is comparable to that of conventional insulin treatment. The risk of ketoacidosis requires more attention from the physician.

Metabolic control in newly kidney transplanted insulin-dependent diabetics: improvement by insulin pump treatment (CSII).,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2969910/),"
Management of glucose homeostasis in newly kidney transplanted insulin-dependent diabetic patients is difficult. To examine whether continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) could reverse this problem, six consecutive kidney-transplanted Type I diabetic patients either proceeded with conventional insulin therapy (CIT) or were changed to CSII beginning on the third postoperative day. After a mean of 13 days, the insulin administration mode was changed from CIT to CSII (n = 3) or from CSII to CIT (n = 3), and continued for a further 15 days. Mean blood glucose calculated on the basis of four daily measurements (8.00, 12.00, 17.00, 22.00 h) during the study periods was significantly lower during CSII (8.0 +/- 0.4 mmol/l, mean +/- SEM) than on CIT (11.0 +/- 0.6 mmol/l; p less than 0.005). Moreover, the variability of blood glucose expressed as the M-value was lower during the pump treatment compared to CIT (p less than 0.001), while the number of blood glucose values below 3.0 mmol/l was similar (3.8 vs. 4.4%). Diurnal metabolic and hormonal profiles were twice determined on each regimen with 2 hourly sampling. Glycemic control was again found to be improved during CSII therapy as compared to CIT (p less than 0.01 or 0.05 less than p less than 0.10). Moreover, insulin pump treatment resulted in a significant reduction of two major intermediary metabolites, lactate and glycerol (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Diurnal plasma profiles of metabolite and hormone concentration in insulin-dependent diabetic patients during conventional insulin treatment and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. A controlled study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3551432/),"
In addition to hyperglycaemia, derangement of metabolic and hormonal control may play an important role in the development of microvascular complications in diabetes. Little, however, is known about the impact of insulin pump treatment on metabolic and hormonal parameters. In a 6-month prospective randomized study in insulin-dependent diabetics we therefore investigated the effects of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion by pump (10 patients) and conventional insulin treatment (10 patients) on the 24-h profiles of blood glucose, glycerol, lactate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, insulin, glucagon and growth hormone by measuring the respective concentrations every 2 h. We found that average blood glucose levels and HbA1c were significantly lower in the group treated by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion as compared with the group on conventional insulin treatment. Furthermore, we observed an improvement in diurnal levels of lactate and 3-hydroxybutyrate in the pump-treated group which was not seen in the conventionally treated group. A slight increment in alanine was seen in the group treated with insulin pump. Serum growth hormone, glycerol, plasma free insulin as well as the daily insulin supply were unchanged and identical in the two groups. It is noteworthy that in the pump group, the decrease in blood glucose and 3-hydroxybutyrate takes place concomitantly with a significant suppression of glucagon.

Risk of ketosis during intensive insulin therapy in pre-school-age diabetic children.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3105985/),"
The risk of ketosis and its relationship to the mode of insulin therapy were studied in a subset of pre-school-age diabetic children. These five children, who initially responded poorly to standard in-hospital diabetes management, were selected for a program of intensified therapy directed at achieving more stable blood glucose control. Optimized conventional therapy was first employed for 16 +/- 5 mo and did not improve substantially blood glucose level or stability. During this period, there was an average of almost one episode of ketonuria per patient per month, and three diabetic ketoacidosis episodes were observed. Because of its limited efficacy, the treatment was then changed to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion. This mode of therapy had a rapid favorable effect on blood glucose control, with no concomitant increase of the frequencies of ketonuria or diabetic ketoacidosis, most of which occurred during the first months of insulin pump therapy. Deliberate cessation of either conventional or subcutaneous insulin infusion therapy for 7 h under close in-hospital control resulted in similar metabolic changes: a slight nonconstant increase of blood glucose, and an abrupt rise of blood 3-hydroxybutyrate to 3 mM, with massive ketonuria. The management of these young diabetic children with insulin pump therapy was thus not associated with an increased frequency or an accelerated rate of development of ketosis. However, the possible failures originating from the infusing device and the rapid increase of ketosis in young ages require special vigilance from the parents, based on twice-daily urine testing for ketones and appropriate insulin supplementation.

Overnight interruption of wearing insulin pump: substitution dose and injection site of insulin.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3542449/),"
Discontinuing wear of the insulin pump for short periods enhances the feasibility of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy. Because insulin requirements differ during pump and injection therapy, we studied the optimal substitution dose and injection site in seven type I diabetic patients to compensate for the overnight (2100-0730 h) interruption of CSII. The missed basal continuous infusion dose was replaced by injecting intermediate-acting insulin subcutaneously in three different ways: 1.5 times the dose in the abdomen, twice the dose in the abdomen, and twice the dose in the buttock. During CSII, glycemia remained unchanged throughout the night. Both 1.5 times and twice the replacement doses injected in the abdomen resulted in an initial decline in blood glucose with hypoglycemia in two patients followed by a rebound rise. When the replacement dose of 1.5 times was used, blood glucose rose by 4.9 +/- 1.2 mM overnight (P less than .02). These changes after abdominal injection were associated with a rapid early absorption of injected insulin with hypoinsulinemia in the morning. With twice the replacement dose injected in the buttock, insulin absorption was slower, fluctuations in nocturnal glycemia were minor, and the blood glucose level at 0730 h was similar to that of the previous night. There was a significant inverse correlation between blood glucose and serum free-insulin levels in the early morning (r = - .60, P less than .01). In conclusion, a substitution dose of 1.5 times to twice the missed basal infusion rate injected in the buttock compensates for the overnight interruption of CSII without risk of major fluctuations in blood glucose levels or nocturnal hypoglycemia.

Insulin pump therapy in the very low birth weight infant.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3763272/),"
Ten critically ill, very low birth weight infants less than 30 weeks' gestation were treated with exogenous insulin administered through a continuous insulin infusion pump (Betatron II, Cardiac Pacemaker, Inc). Infants were hyperglycemic to dextrose infusions greater than 6 mg/kg/min. The blood glucose concentration became normal in all infants within two to four hours, with varying requirements for continued insulin treatment. Tolerance to intravenous dextrose increased from a mean of 7.4 mg/kg/min to 11.2 mg/kg/min with glycosuria. Energy intake increased from 49.5 calories/kg/d prior to insulin pump therapy to 70.4 calories/kg/d afterward (P less than .01) with weight gain changed from -23 g/d to +13 g/d (P less than .01). One unexpected observation was the apparent normalization of blood glucose homeostasis on higher dextrose doses among some infants after only one three- to six-hour treatment with insulin. The continuous insulin infusion pump is a flexible tool that allows insulin infusion rates to be changed as dictated by blood glucose values without altering other parenteral infusions.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion fails to correct impaired basal glucose metabolism and impaired insulin sensitivity of adipocytes from patients with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3514067/),"
Studies of the in vivo insulin action in conventionally treated Type 1 diabetic patients have shown insulin resistance, especially in poorly controlled patients. We reported previously on impaired basal and insulin-stimulated glucose utilization in adipocytes from Type 1 diabetic subjects. In this study we have examined whether a near-normalization of glycaemia and plasma levels of metabolites in Type 1 diabetic patients induced by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion might reverse abnormalities of adipose tissue metabolism. 11 Type 1 diabetic subjects who had been treated conventionally with diet and insulin for 11 yr were studied before and after continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for 6 months. In Type 1 diabetic patients before insulin pump treatment we found decreased adipocyte insulin binding (p less than 0.01), normal insulin binding to monocytes and erythrocytes, impaired insulin sensitivity of the adipocyte glucose transport (p = 0.02) and reduced basal and maximally insulin-stimulated rates of adipocyte glucose oxidation and lipogenesis (all p less than 0.05). After pump therapy for 6 months we found a further reduction of basal and maximal adipocyte glucose oxidation and lipogenesis (all p less than or equal to 0.05), whereas we found no significant changes of insulin receptor binding or insulin sensitivity of adipocyte glucose utilization. We conclude that continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion of Type 1 diabetic patients for 6 months aggravates the defects in basal (non-insulin-stimulated) and maximally insulin-stimulated glucose utilization of isolated adipocytes despite an optimization of glycaemic control and a near-normalization of plasma metabolites.

Effect of insulin pump treatment for one year on renal function and retinal morphology in patients with IDDM.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4075944/),"
The effect of strict metabolic control for 1 yr on renal function and retinal morphology was estimated in 24 insulin-dependent diabetic individuals (age 29 +/- 8 yr, diabetes duration 10 +/- 6 yr) with Albustix negative urine and minimal or no background retinopathy before the study. They were randomized to conventional insulin treatment (CIT) or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with a portable pump. During CSII treatment the metabolic status was significantly improved and glomerular filtration rates (GFR) were found to decline (from 130 +/- 18 to 116 +/- 15 ml/min/1.73 m2, P less than 0.01). The mean value of urinary albumin excretion (UAE) was not statistically significantly reduced (from 15.3 +/- 24.1 to 6.8 +/- 1.5 mg/24 h, P greater than 0.1). In the CIT group both GFR and UAE values were unchanged. In all subjects before treatment we found a positive correlation between the metabolic status, estimated by the HbA1c values, and GFR as well as UAE values, respectively (r = 0.64, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.42, P less than 0.05). We conclude that elevated GFR values can be reduced toward normal level by insulin pump treatment for 1 yr. Retinal morphology was found to deteriorate in four of 12 CIT subjects and in three of 12 CSII subjects. However, the progression was mild and in most individuals only due to a slight increase in the number of microaneurysms. Pump treatment did not induce proliferation and ""cotton-wool"" exudates were not detectable in any pump subject after 1 yr of treatment. We conclude that CSII treatment for 1 yr was unable to stop the progression of retinopathy in individuals with minimal or no retinopathy on entering the study. On the other hand, pump treatment did not induce cotton-wool exudates or proliferation in these subjects as previously reported in subjects with more severe retinopathy before CSII treatment.

To determine the long-term efficacy of insulin-pump therapy, we analyzed trends in glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations in 127 patients with Type I diabetes using insulin pumps for periods ranging from 13 to 47 months. In the first year of pump therapy the average glycosylated hemoglobin concentration improved in 83 per cent of the patients, as compared with the value before pump therapy. Although only 11 of the 127 subjects had normal glycosylated hemoglobin values before pump therapy, 33 had a normal average value during the first full year of pump use (P = 0.0001). This favorable trend persisted for the three-year duration of the study. Seventeen of the 19 patients who subsequently discontinued insulin-pump therapy had improved glycosylated hemoglobin values during the period of pump use. Eleven of the 19 patients remained available for follow-up study; the glycosylated hemoglobin concentration became worse in 7 when they returned to conventional treatment. We conclude that the improvement in metabolic control repeatedly demonstrated in short-term studies with the insulin pump can be maintained for a period of years.

Current debate about the use of insulin infusion pumps in the treatment of diabetes mellitus is partly attributable to a lack of available data about the long-term course of patients who use pumps. We evaluated the course of our first 20 patients treated with insulin infusion pumps. Two or more years after the inception of therapy, only half of these patients were still using the insulin infusion pump. Psychosocial stresses, which affected glycemic control, were identified retrospectively in a majority of patients, but were not appreciated when pump therapy was initiated, despite our best attempts to do so. Mean hemoglobin A1 levels decreased significantly for the entire group and for the subgroup that did not discontinue pump therapy. These results suggest that insulin pump programs must have the resources to provide appropriate support for all candidates, including unsuitable candidates, who present for treatment with insulin infusion pumps.

Although there was no significant difference between treatment groups with respect to the number of patients experiencing severe hypoglycemia (i.e., requiring intravenous glucose or intramuscular glucagon injection), there were nine episodes in six patients during CSII compared with one episode during CIT. Diabetic ketoacidosis occurred significantly more often in the CSII group (nine episodes in eight patients) than in the CIT group (no episodes). A number of CSII-related failures occurred, including omission of premeal bolus, needle dislodgement, pump accidentally turned off, and leakage at the infusion site. At 8 mo, 85% of CSII-treated patients wished to continue indefinitely on the pump, and almost all would continue with self-monitoring of blood glucose even if they stopped CSII.

Intensive insulin therapy reduces counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia in patients with type I diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3893253/),"
Counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia were examined in six healthy controls and in six patients with type I diabetes before and after 4 to 8 months of insulin pump treatment. The insulin clamp technique was used to provide an identical hypoglycemic stimulus (about 50 mg/dL) in each study group. Before pump treatment, the release of counterregulatory hormones (except glucagon) during the hypoglycemic period was not significantly different in diabetics from that in normal controls. However, when values before and after pump treatment in diabetics were compared, there were significant reductions in epinephrine (304 +/- 70 and 127 +/- 43 pg/mL; p less than 0.01), growth hormone (45 +/- 12 and 18 +/- 5 ng/mL; p less than 0.05), and cortisol (20 +/- 3 and 10 +/- 2 micrograms/dL; p less than 0.01) levels during hypoglycemia. Defective glucagon release during hypoglycemia in the diabetics was not corrected by pump treatment. Intensive insulin treatment of patients with type I diabetes causes a generalized reduction in counterregulatory hormone release after a moderate fall in blood glucose levels. This reduction may impair glucose counterregulation and diminish perception of hypoglycemia, thereby increasing the risk of hypoglycemic episodes.

The insulin pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21274024/),"
Subcutaneous continuous insulin infusion systems deliver insulin at a basal rate designed to keep blood glucose levels normal in the non-fed state. Additional insulin is delivered at meal time. Pumps can provide near optimal control of blood glucose concentrations in selected, highly motivated patients. The pump provides better diabetic control than once daily insulin injections, although several daily injections can provide comparable control. Optimal control with the pump causes some short-term beneficial metabolic changes, but there are no controlled clinical trials evaluating the long-term effect on complications. Insulin pump therapy should be initiated only for highly motivated, well instructed patients in a supportive clinical setting. The hazards include rapid development of uncontrolled diabetes when insulin infusion stops, and development of hypoglycemia in the basal rate mode.

Complications of insulin infusion pump therapy include ketoacidosis related to interruption of insulin delivery and infected infusion sites. To determine if the type of insulin used in insulin pumps is a factor influencing these complications, we compared the occurrence of inflammation and infection at infusion sites and obstruction of infusion tubing in a 6-mo crossover study of 28 patients using two different insulin preparations. The use of buffered purified pork insulin was associated with less infusion site inflammation (P = 0.0039) and infusion set obstruction (P = 0.0215) than use of unbuffered beef-pork insulin. Infected infusion sites occurred less often with buffered pure pork insulin than with unbuffered beef-pork insulin, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that the type of insulin selected for use in insulin pumps influences the occurrence of adverse reactions to insulin pump therapy: buffered purified pork insulin is associated with less infusion site inflammation and infusion set obstruction than unbuffered beef-pork insulin.

On the fourth day of each period, blood glucose and plasma-free insulin were estimated every 30 min for 7 hr and every 5 min for the next hour. Plasma-free insulin was significantly higher on 3 time points out of the 26 possible when using the Medix pump, but this was not reflected in the blood glucose concentrations which were similar in the 2 periods. The results indicate that, from a metabolic and pharmacokinetic point of view, insulin pumps working with larger intervals between the basal rate pulses are just as good as the more technically advanced and hence often more expensive pumps which provide the basal rate in more and smaller pulses.

Mealtimes were varied considerably on both conventional and pump therapy (as much as 110 +/- 19 and 126 +/- 20 minutes, respectively), but mealtime delays were reported to be manageable while the patients were using the pump. The practices of eating larger meals or additional snacks compensated for by extra insulin significantly increased during CSII therapy. Partly as a consequence of such practices, patients experienced a significant weight gain of 7.2 +/- 2 lb during pump treatment (p less than .005). Clearly, prospective studies are needed to determine the acceptable degree of dietary flexibility and the optimal management of diet during insulin pump therapy.

Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) with a portable pump was compared to unchanged conventional treatment (UCT) in long-term treated patients with IDDM in order to evaluate changes in glucose homeostasis, metabolites, hormones and quality of life. We found that the mean blood glucose values, measured at home, and the HbA1c values were significantly lower in the CSII group compared to the UCT group. The improved control during CSII was followed by a nearly normalization of the diurnal pattern of FFA and ketone bodies in plasma. Plasma free insulin values were significantly higher in the morning (fasting) during CSII compared to UCT, whereas the mean diurnal concentrations and the diurnal pattern were identical in the 2 groups. Both peak values of growth hormone during the day and the fasting values were significantly lower in the CSII group compared to the UCT group. In patients treated with the insulin pump (CSII) the wellbeing (quality of life) was estimated to be significantly improved. Two patients developed ketoacidosis during CSII, whereas 2 controls (UCT) were hospitalized with hypoglycemic coma. We conclude that insulin pump treatment for 6 months results in a near normalization of glucose and FFA metabolism, resulting in an improved quality of life. The improved control seems not to be explained by a change of the diurnal pattern of plasma insulin. However, the higher morning values may be of significant importance.

Because of the metabolic instability, all were given continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) via portable externally worn infusion pump. During 6 months of CSII, there was marked improvement: hemoglobin A1 decreased from 192% +/- 8% (SD) to 152% +/- 31% of the normal mean (P less than 0.02), and hypoglycemic episodes decreased in both severity and frequency. CSII was incorporated into the children's treatment with no appreciable adverse psychologic effects or interference with normal activities. CSII, under carefully controlled clinical conditions, may be of benefit in some preschool children with unacceptable metabolic control of diabetes mellitus.

Association of insulin pump therapy with raised serum amyloid A in type I diabetes mellitus.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6142148/),"
Serum concentrations of serum amyloid A protein, the high-density-lipoprotein-associated tissue amyloid A precursor, were determined in 29 diabetic patients receiving insulin by subcutaneous injection and in 50 receiving subcutaneous infusion pump therapy. Insulin delivered by continuous subcutaneous pumps stimulated serum amyloid A production to levels nearly six times those in normal subjects, nearly twice as much as insulin given by subcutaneous injection. 85% of patients with serum amyloid A levels greater than or equal to 10(4) ng/ml were being treated with insulin pump therapy. The relation between insulin aggregation and amyloid A in diabetes was evaluated in 1 patient; treatment with syringe-aggregated insulin resulted in a nearly 300% increase in serum amyloid A levels. The use of high-potency non-aggregating insulins in the pump treatment of type I diabetic patients may be necessary for optimum therapy.

Predicting insulin requirements for a portable insulin pump using the Biostator. Evidence for reversible insulin resistance in poorly controlled type I diabetics.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6352376/),"
Glycemic control was achieved in 14 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by 36-48-h treatment with a recently marketed clinical model, Biostator glucose controller (Life Science Instruments, Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, Indiana). Control was maintained by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion with a portable pump, programmed using infusion profiles from the Biostator. Control of glycemic excursion with the Biostator was variable among patients. This control, reflected by the M-value or a blood glucose index (mean of pre-, peak, and 2-h postmeal levels for four meals) of each patient, correlated directly with their prior glycemic control, as assessed by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level (r = 0.66, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.82, P less than 0.005, for M-value and blood glucose index, respectively). Total insulin infused by the Biostator/24 h overpredicted the subcutaneous infusion dose required on day 2 of pump treatment (183 +/- 11%, P less 0.001). Therefore, these data were not used to program the portable pump. Instead, total insulin dose was estimated using a dietary glucose/insulin (G/I) ratio. This ratio, derived from dietary total available glucose, urine glucose, and insulin dose/24 h during depot insulin treatment, accurately estimated total insulin for pump infusion (97 +/- 4%). The basal infusion rate of the Biostator between 2400 and 0600 h also exceeded the subcutaneous infusion requirement and was reduced to 40% for the initial pump basal rate. The remainder of the insulin (total minus basal) was distributed as premeal boluses according to the Biostator infusion profile for meals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Clinical application of insulin pumps in the management of insulin dependent diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6351759/),"
Seven volunteers aged 12.0 to 17.9 years participated in a trial to compare conventional insulin treatment with continuous open loop (pump) insulin infusion. After 6 weeks of conventional treatment followed by 6 weeks of insulin pump treatment, 4 children chose to manage their diabetes permanently by means of the insulin pump. The mean blood glucose concentration (based on home blood glucose monitoring) while on conventional insulin treatment showed no appreciable change during the 6 weeks' treatment on an insulin pump. Compared with conventional treatment, however, the mean 24 hour blood glucose profiles of the patients on pump insulin showed less variation in the blood glucose throughout the day, together with an appreciably lower peak after breakfast. These improvements occurred despite increased dietary flexibility while on pump insulin. The insulin pump seems to be an acceptable form of treatment for some children and young adults with diabetes mellitus and gives near physiological control of blood glucose.

The use of insulin pump therapy in adolescents.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6571167/),"
Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) systems have been used in diabetes management since the mid-1970s. Investigators have reported encouraging results with CSII use in adult subjects with dramatically improved glucose control, reversal of some complications, and high acceptance and compliance rates. We have studied 10 adolescents and 3 young adults using CSII for diabetes management. Only the three young adults (ages 20, 24, 34 years) have had markedly improved metabolic control, sustained pump use, and made adequate psychological adjustment to CSII therapy. Adolescent subjects, (ages 9-17 years), experienced problems with peer acceptance of pumps, had difficulty with infusion needle insertion and skin care, were unable to perform home blood glucose monitoring consistently, made nonadvised manipulations of insulin dosage and reported mechanical problems with CSII devices more frequently than the young adult subjects. Mean duration of CSII use in adolescent subjects (6.1 months) was significantly less than mean use (30.6 months) among the young adults (p less than 0.01). Currently, adults appear to have greater success than adolescents in using CSII for diabetes management.

[Blood sugar control in diabetics with the insulin pump. Comparison with discontinuous injections].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6291163/),"
Eighteen insulin-dependent diabetic patients received insulin in a continuous subcutaneous infusion delivered by a portable pump. Short-term glycemic control was evaluated on the average glycemia (serum glucose was assayed seven times per 24 hours for three to five days), on the MAGE coefficient which gives an estimate of glycemic lability, and, in eight patients, on serum C-peptide concentrations. Results were compared to those recorded with two daily subcutaneous injections of a combination of regular and intermediate insulin. The average glycemia and the MAGE coefficient were 1.32 + 0.05 milligram (m + SEM) and 1 + 0.05 milligram respectively under continuous infusion, compared to 2.05 + 0.12 and 1.76 + 0.12 milligram respectively under insulin injections. Insulin requirements were significantly lower under continuous infusion (0.99 + 0.08 U/kg versus 1.35 + 0.11 U/kg). In three patients with brittle diabetes the use of the pump ensured rapid metabolic control. The advantages and drawbacks of portable insulin pumps are discussed in the light of this experience.

Clinical use of the insulin infusion pump in 100 patients with type I diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7099222/),"
We investigated the efficacy of insulin-pump therapy in insulin-dependent diabetics, aged 18 to 69 years, by comparing the metabolic control achieved in 100 patients using this technique with that previously obtained by conventional insulin therapy. Patients were followed during pump therapy for as long as 15 months. Fasting and nonfasting blood glucose levels (mean +/- S.E.M.) decreased from 201 +/- 6 and 213 +/- 6 mg per deciliter (11.2 +/- 0.3 and 11.8 +/- 0.3 mmol per liter), respectively, to 158 +/- 5 and 145 +/- 3 mg per deciliter (8.77 +/- 0.3 and 8.05 +/- 0.2 mmol per liter) after one month of pump therapy (P less than 0.001). Ninety-three patients had improved blood sugar control; 71 per cent had a mean blood sugar concentration of 150 mg per deciliter (8.3 mmol per liter) or less after six months. Glycosylated hemoglobin values became normal in 44 per cent of 88 patients who had follow-up determinations. In over 500 patient-months there were four episodes of ketoacidosis and five episodes of serious hypoglycemia. Three patients abandoned pump therapy. We conclude that insulin-pump therapy is acceptable to patients and that it can be successfully applied to clinical practice and large-scale research studies.

Intensive ambulatory treatment of insulin-dependent diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7049031/),"
The therapy for insulin-dependent diabetes has been changing in the last 3 years with the increasing application of intensive ambulatory treatment programs involving self-monitoring of blood glucose levels by the patient. Insulin is administered either as multiple manual daily injections or as a continuous subcutaneous infusion delivered by a portable pump. We discuss the implementation, efficacy, complications (including recent reports of deaths in pump-treated patients), and cost of such programs. The potential effectiveness in preventing the long-term complications of diabetes warrants offering a program of self-monitoring of blood glucose levels combined with multiple manual daily insulin injections as a routine treatment option to virtually all patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Additional observations on safety and efficacy are needed before insulin pump treatment can be considered a routine option. Furthermore, whether intensive treatment involving either manual or pump administration of insulin alters the risk of hypoglycemia as compared with conventional management remains to be established.

The use of an implantable insulin pump in the treatment of type II diabetes.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7045666/),"
We treated five patients with Type II diabetes by means of a subcutaneously implanted intravenous insulin pump and compared their metabolic response with that observed during conventional insulin therapy. The use of the pump improved control of glycemia, as manifested by reductions in mean plasma glucose (from 188 +/- 46 to 106 +/- 12 mg per deciliter [mean +/- S.D.]), fasting glucose (from 187 +/- 42 to 80 +/- 13 mg per deciliter), and postprandial glucose (from 287 +/- 74 to 182 +/- 29 mg per deciliter), together with a diminution of glycemic excursion and normalization of glycosylated hemoglobin A1 (from 12.1 +/- 2 to 8.0 +/- 1 per cent). At the end of the study the pumps had been in place for a mean of 7.0 months (range, 5.5 to 9.7 months) without mishap and with good patient acceptance. Our data suggest that improved blood glucose control can be achieved by means of a permanently implanted continuous insulin-infusion device in ambulatory patients with Type II diabetes who require insulin, and that the need for daily insulin injections can thereby be eliminated.

Intensive conventional and insulin pump therapies in adult type I diabetes. A crossover study.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7046554/),"
We examined the relative efficacy of two modes of insulin therapy in five patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. Using a crossover protocol, therapy with multiple insulin injections was compared with the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (pump therapy); both therapies were regulated by home blood glucose monitoring. Although both therapies were equally effective during 2 to 4 days of inpatient management, pump therapy was clearly superior in the outpatient setting. Mean plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c concentrations and the frequency of hypoglycemic reactions were significantly less with pump therapy despite apparently equal compliance with both therapies. We conclude that in compliant adult patients with type I diabetes continuous insulin infusion is more effective in achieving normalization of plasma glucose concentration than intensified conventional therapy in the outpatient setting. Although these patients found pump therapy preferable to intensive conventional therapy, the superiority of pump therapy is not explained by this bias. Whether these results are applicable in a more standard treatment setting remains to be established.

Influence of long-term insulin infusion pump treatment of type I diabetes on diabetic retinopathy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6750494/),"
Isolated case reports have suggested short-term beneficial effects of subcutaneous insulin infusion pump treatment on background and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. To evaluate this question further, 30 eyes of 15 Type I diabetic patients were evaluated prospectively before and after 11--23 months (mean 18.1 months) of pump treatment. In each patient plasma glucose and total glycosylated hemoglobin fell to normal or near normal levels. The ten eyes without diabetic retinopathy at entry remained without. Four of 20 eyes with diabetic retinopathy at entry advanced by modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) classification, including one eye that progressed from background to proliferative diabetic retinopathy. No eyes with diabetic retinopathy improved their modified ETDRS classification. One eye progressed to blindness; no other eye lost vision. Six eyes had laser treatment prior to insulin pump treatment; four of these and two more required laser during pump treatment. Two eyes had vitreous hemorrhages prior to pump treatment; one of these and four others hemorrhaged during pump treatment. No eyes with diabetic retinopathy showed regression of microvascular changes. The data suggest prolonged restoration of near normal glucose metabolism with the insulin pump does not reverse established diabetic retinopathy. Whether pump treatment slows the progression, or prevents the development, of diabetic retinopathy remains to be established.

Long-term improvement of metabolic control with the insulin pump does not reverse diabetic microangiopathy.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7188047/),"
Restoration of near-normal glucose metabolism with the insulin pump reduces retinal fluorescein leakage and microalbuminuria in diabetes. However, it is not known whether these functional changes reflect a true reversal of diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy. To evaluate this question, we studied the effect of 1-2 yr of insulin pump treatment on clinical endpoints in 17 type I diabetic patients. In each patient, plasma glucose and total glycosylated hemoglobin levels fell to normal or near-normal levels. The total daily dose of insulin given during the first month of pump treatment (52 +/- 5 U/day) was comparable to that given during conventional treatment (44 +/- 3 U/day) and varied little over the 1-2 yr period of observation. Ten eyes without retinopathy at the start of the study remained without retinopathy after 15-23 mo of pump treatment. One of eleven eyes with background retinopathy developed proliferative retinopathy and 3 of 13 eyes with proliferative retinopathy progressed during pump treatment. Similarly, no improvement in renal function was observed in the six patients with diabetic nephropathy on entry to the study. In the first month of pump treatment, proteinuria consistently fell to values 30% below prepump levels (P less than 0.005). However, the diminution in proteinuria was not sustained and all remain proteinuric after 13-18 mo of pump therapy. Serum creatinine rose slightly and creatinine clearance did not significantly change. These data suggest that insulin pump treatment does not reverse established diabetic microvascular complications, despite a sustained improvement in metabolic control for up to 2 yr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

Psychological effects of intensification of diabetic control.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/6765119/),"
We studied the psychological effects of a program of intensification of glycemic control, using three different insulin regimens: (1) twice-daily regular and lente insulin; (2) multiple preprandial doses of regular insulin coupled with long-acting ultralente insulin; and (3) continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). Ten patients used each of the regimens for periods of 2 mo. Patients monitored blood glucose 4-7 times daily. Using the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, there were significant reductions in depression, interpersonal sensitivity, and anxiety during all three treatment programs. Self-concept scores were more positive following CSII therapy. Positive self-concept ratings were correlated with positive attitudes about diabetes, medical care, persons with diabetes, and current diabetes regimens. After all subjects had experienced CSII, self-concept was positively related to attitudes regarding the insulin pump. Patients reporting more positive attitudes toward their current diabetes regimens had lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels. Thus, there were no adverse psychological effects of blood glucose monitoring, intensification of therapy, or use of infusion pumps by the parameters measured.

[Treatment of unstable diabetes with a portable insulin-infusion pump (author's transl)].,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7037348/),"
A portable insulin-infusion pump (Promedos Siemens) was used in 19 patients with unstable or brittle diabetes. Continuous insulin supply was via the intravenous route in nine, subcutaneously in ten patients. The insulin pump was used in those patients in whom, after hospitalization for two to three weeks, the diabetes remained poorly controlled. In all patients the carbohydrate metabolism was normalised. Subcutaneous insulin infusion was as effective as the intravenous one. In all instances it was possible, partly by transferring insulin uptake during the day and night to two subcutaneous injections, to improve conventional control even after the infusion period was over. Continuous, regulated insulin supply - intravenously or subcutaneously - is superior to conventional subcutaneous administration. Portable insulin infusion pumps can be used in individual patients even without glucose sensing.

Efficacy of the insulin pump in the home treatment of pregnant diabetics.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7028543/),"
The efficacy and feasibility of the insulin infusion pump in pregnancy were examined in seven class D to FR diabetics, maintained on the pump at home from 10 to 29 wk gestation until delivery. An improvement in glucose control was achieved within the first month and sustained to term. Home monitoring demonstrated a fall in mean blood glucose levels from 135 mg/dl range 98-175, prepump) to 104 mg/dl (range 84-120) and a 25-30% reduction in standard deviations during pump treatment. Furthermore, glycosylated hemoglobin levels were normalized in each patient. During periodic inpatient evaluations, mean 24-h plasma glucose levels were slightly, but not significantly, lower after pump treatment (97 vs 86 mg/dl). However, glycemic excursions were strikingly diminished; MAGE values and standard deviations fell by 45% and 34%, respectively. The total daily insulin dose required at the start of pump treatment was 31% less than the conventional dose used before the pump (P less than 0.002). Thereafter the insulin dose increased by approximately 2.5 U/wk, with the basal infusion remaining at 40% of the total dose throughout the pregnancy. All infants were born at term, had no macrosomia or neonatal problems, and had normal intravenous glucose tolerance tests at 2 h of age. We conclude that the insulin infusion pump, managed at home, is a highly efficient way to achieve normal or near-normal glucose levels in the pregnant diabetic.

We examined whether changes in somatomedin accompany those seen in glucose and growth hormone during treatment with the insulin-infusion pump. somatomedin levels in eight insulin-dependent diabetics (13 to 29 years of age) were measured before and after 16 weeks of outpatient insulin-pump treatment, which lowered mean glucose from 245 +/- 21 to 100 +/- 5 mg per deciliter and total glycosylated hemoglobin from 16.2 +/- 1.2 to 9.7 +/- 0.3 per cent (mean +/- S.E.M.). During conventional insulin therapy, both total somatomedin and somatomedin C were within the normal range, despite elevations in growth hormone. Pump treatment resulted in a 70 to 75 per cent increase in both total somatomedin and somatomedin C (P less than 0.05) and a fall in growth-hormone concentrations. In the two growing adolescents, growth velocity doubled during 13 to 15 months of pump treatment. Our data suggest that the improved insulin delivery or metabolic control increases somatomedin levels despite a decrease in growth hormone. Thus, insulin-pump treatment may be useful in optimizing growth in diabetic children.

Restoration of normal lipid and aminoacid metabolism in diabetic patients treated with a portable insulin-infusion pump.,[Pubmed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/87725/),"
To determine whether abnormalities of lipid and aminoacid metabolism observed in diabetes are corrected when plasma-glucose levels are restored to normal, eight insulin-dependent diabetics were treated for 7-14 days with a portable infusion pump which delivers insulin subcutaneously in basal (between-meal) doses with pulse-dose increments before meals. Mean plasma-glucose (206 +/- 24 mg/dl during conventional insulin treatment) fell to 89 +/- 3 mg/dl at day 7 and 84 +/- 2 mg/dl at day 14 of pump treatment; glycosuria was eliminated. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids were elevated during conventional insulin treatment but fell to normal after 7 days of pump treatment. Plasma-levels of branched-chain aminoacids were 50-60% above control levels during conventional treatment but fell to normal after 7 days of pump therapy. Aminoacids were reduced from their high postprandial levels to normal values after insulin-pump treatment. In addition to restoring plasma-glucose to normal, treatment of diabetes with a portable insulin-infusion system results in restoration of normal lipid and aminoacid metabolism. Long-term use of this system may determine whether metabolic changes resulting from insulin lack cause the complications of diabetes.
